Some things I'm bad at:
- Using the phone
- Messaging someone
- Resolving conflicts
- Dressing (lol)
- Organising tasks
- Being patient
- Not focusing too much on things

Significant events:
- Me vs Connor shooting down my ideas, working out my place, trying to keep spirits up, trying to find places to contribute
- My second team not sharing contacts details on the first day
+ Creating a Discord and bringing everyone together before it was too late
- My failed game pitch (too outlandish)
- No rehearsal on my game pitch
- Pair programming, and being ahead of everyone else
- Stressing out Tomas: first signs of learning how to inspire
- Learning with Tomas, the improvements over time
- Taking more breaks
- Beren.
- Smooth sailing during development of Frontier
- Classes and inheritance: should they all call parent init?
- Making sprite rotation and the time it took to get it working
- Learning to reduce focus on such problems
- Essay week and a world of pain. Managing word count
- Peer reviews and a full day of trying to review work (making work too hard)
- Taking Michael's advice on a prototype collision system
- Trying to make a presentation last-minute with my team
- Performing in the presentation, doing a save on the 'but is it too difficult' question

Present day!:
- Handling word count and depth of insight etc

Aspirations:
- To release Critical Critters
- To code a game
- To also have significant impact on the game concept
- To run a studio
- To be successful at reaching out
- To work in teams

Consequential aspirations:
- To be better at reaching out
 - To reduce social anxiety
- To adapt to industry practice
- To adapt to industry languages
 - While still pushing the boundaries of performance

Flaws:

Current domain coverage:
Affective:
Dispositional: Focus and task-switching
Interpersonal:
Procedural: Resolving collision detection
Cognitive: Class inheritance

What I got better at:
- Presentations
- OOP:
 - Learning, through Python, the usefulness of C++-style programming and the 'new' operator
 - Well except the RAII problem
