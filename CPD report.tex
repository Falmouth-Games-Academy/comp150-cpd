\section{Introduction}

In this paper I will discuss five key skills, taken from my continuing professional development report that I need to improve on to succeed on my course. Also by using SMART targets as a guide, I will first state the skill, and why it is important to increase my ability, not just for my course, but in terms of my future career as well. Secondly how I plan to improve that skill and how long I expect it to take me to reach my goals.
