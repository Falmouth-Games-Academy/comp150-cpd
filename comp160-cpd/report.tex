\section{Introduction}



\section{Communicating effectively with team members about job allocation}
Found myself with no jobs or having to wait around, should step out of my comfort zone and maybe tackle tasks that I am not familiar or comfortable with, or lie outside my area of expertise.


\section{Use of version control and branching}
Learn to use all of the available features of the VC as not having full use of it lead my work causing conflictions and slowed develop time. 


\section{Learning new tools and skills}
I was nearly almost behind when learning new things such as using the server and blueprints. 

\section{Time management on coding projects}


\section{Finding solutions for new problems}


\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here. Though the conclusion should be brief, no more than 100 words, it should do more than merely summarise the report. Focus on the five SMART actions that you intend to take in order to overcome any challenges and/or obstacles. Contextualise how this will help you towards your intended career goal and how this may improve your project for the next semester.
