\section{Introduction}



\section{Communicating effectively with team members}
The first skill that came to my attention was that I do not communicate effectively with my team about my job allocation, and I have started to find myself undertaking work, only find out it has already been done, or a colleague was currently is in the development process. Without this skill, my future work in a professional context would be very difficult as the development cycles of games are very finely planned, and my small piece of work might be integral to a much larger part being completed, so it is important that I gain this skill before moving forward, as without it, my work flow may hold up others, and then I may rush to get it done and produce poor work, which is not favourable in any context. To overcome this issue, I will endevour to communicate more with teammates about the jobs at the hand and what I should be doing to make myself most useful, and if I do this, I should see an increase my productivity and more of my work getting into the project, and as I will start work on this task as soon as possible, I should see a change soon, or atleast when I start my next group project; and I feel that this task is more than realisitic as it only involves me communciating more, which is easily done. 

\section{Use of version control and branching}
Learn to use all of the available features of the VC as not having full use of it lead my work causing conflictions and slowed develop time. 


\section{Learning new tools and skills}
I was nearly almost behind when learning new things such as using the server and blueprints. 

\section{Time management on coding projects}
Time managment is still plaguing me from last term, although I had started to use my calender to plot out when I had dates due 

\section{Finding solutions for new problems}
Never go outside of my comfort zone as I find it hard to ask for help and end up wasting my time. 

\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here. Though the conclusion should be brief, no more than 100 words, it should do more than merely summarise the report. Focus on the five SMART actions that you intend to take in order to overcome any challenges and/or obstacles. Contextualise how this will help you towards your intended career goal and how this may improve your project for the next semester.
