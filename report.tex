\section{Introduction}

Write your introduction here. A brief introduction of about 100 words is recommended, which should state your career  goal and the five key skills that you wish to highlight from your weekly reports. When choosing which skills to focus on for this report, be specific. Avoid choosing broad skills that are clearly important for any student, such as \textit{time management} or \textit{communication}. Instead, make it more granular. Consider which specific aspects of these broad areas are a priority for you, personally, and what may have caused or exacerbated the challenge. Tutors are not assessing your knowledge of general study skills. Rather, they are assessing your ability to analyse and reflect on your own learning and personal development as an individual and towards becoming a computing professional.

\section{Dealing with Frustration}

Dealing with frustration when code doesn't work and using turning that frustration into productive problem solving.

\section{Team Communication and Direction}

Keeping whole team in contact and participating in develpoment. Some team members became
somewhat estranged from the develpment process and better management and communication on
my part could help ensure everyone is contributing and finding something they are able to
participate in.


\section{Unbiased Time Management}

Lack of time managment for essays compared to programming. More interested in programming
so spend more time on progrmaming tasks than essay tasks.

\section{Game-Specific Programming Features}

Better knowledge of game-specific or game-relevant programming aspects such as vectors,
deltatime, etc

\section{Problem Identification}

The ability to more quickly identify the origin of programming problems. 

\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here. Though the conclusion should be brief, no more than 100 words, it should do more than merely summarise the report. Focus on the five SMART actions that you intend to take in order to overcome any challenges and/or obstacles. Contextualise how this will help you towards your intended career goal and how this may improve your project for the next semester.
