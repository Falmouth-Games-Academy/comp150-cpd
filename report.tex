\section{Introduction}

Write your introduction here. A brief introduction of about 100 words is recommended, which should state your career goal and the five key skills that you wish to highlight from your weekly reports. When choosing which skills to focus on for this report, be specific. Avoid choosing broad skills that are clearly important for any student, such as \textit{time management} or \textit{communication}. Instead, make it more granular. Consider which specific aspects of these broad areas are a priority for you, personally, and what may have caused or exacerbated the challenge. Tutors are not assessing your knowledge of general study skills. Rather, they are assessing your ability to analyse and reflect on your own learning and personal development as an individual and towards becoming a computing professional. 

One from each section of the thing.

\section{Adaptability/Flexibility}

Then, suggest how to overcome the challenge/obstacle in relation to a SMART action. When planning such actions, do not be too general. Consider SMART actions:
specific; measurable; achievable; relevant; and time-bound. Ensure that your proposed action for future development meets all five of these criteria.

Confidence when in situations that are unfamiliar/Adaptability. SMART Target towards each skill that needs to be improved.
