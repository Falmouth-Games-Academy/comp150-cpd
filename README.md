Session 3 - Agile Game Development
In this lecture, we learned about the agile philosophy and how it is applied in SCRUM. In addition, we made a product backlog and a sprint task board using Trello. The major challenge was actually figuring out how each of these worked both alone and together. While they will still take some time to get used to, they have become easier to understand after playing around with them. 

Session 4 - Tinkering Graphics I
During this lecture, we learned how to apply graphics -- such as printing "Hello world!" with different background colours. The challenging part was the actual application of said graphics, as I was quite uncertain on what you really had to type in order to get your wanted results. I overcame this challenge by reading the tutorial guides on pygame's website, and by taking a peek at the code that was submitted on Slack by other students to further understand and analyse what I was actually implementing. 

In general:
Time management has become an apparent challenge after realising what will need to be done throughout the coming months. Activities and submissions  like reading and writing for the research journal & agile essay while dedicating time to learn Python programming - among others - have started to inflict overwhelming feelings. Although this is not surprising, as these are indeed our first steps toward a competitive field in the industry.
