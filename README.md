# comp150-cpd

## Week 1 - Beginning 12th September
Having only moved in on Saturday, University life started for me this week with my first two talks on Monday, but these were more overviews in general about what the university and the course expects of me, so no real learning has taken place yet, but I will soon need to attend some events actually relevant to the course. And of course, with a new environment and course comes a brand new set of people, and normally I find that it doesn't take me too long to to mix and intergrate with new people, but regardless, this will be a challenge. I can hopefully overcome this challege by attending the upcoming events and classes such as the Programmer Mixer and the Welcome Meeting and getting to know my coursemates better, and hopefully furthering these interactions by attending the Lego Mindstorms event next week will allow me to further build these foundations, as not knowing my coursemates will defeneitly have an effect on my communicative skills at a later date, which could end up affecting my group project. 
 
## Week 2 - Beginning 19th September
With this being my first "proper" week at University, I am now beginning to become accustomed with the finer details and workings of how my course and the overall establishment operate and what it expects of me, and my first meeting with my personal tutor really helped to cement this. Having completed several group activites with other members of my course, such as the Lego Mindstorms challenge this week, I feel much more comfortable talking and interacting with other members of my group, which was an issue I raised last week. This weeks challenge seemed to lie firmly with time managment, although my team's robot was equipped with all the physical tools to achieve all of the challenges, we simply underestimated the amount of time that it would take to program the robot to complete all of the challenges witht the correct amount of precision, and thus we did not actually complete all of the challenges that we wanted to do, so striving to improve my time management by carefully examining the given tasks will defenietly help me with future projects.  

## Week 3 - Beginning 26th September
This week I actually started to begin using the IDE's and the first programming language that I would have to become familiar with, which is Python, and unluckily for me I have quite limited experience with Python as I used different languages in my BTEC course, but I'm beginning to pick up the fundamentals from the books and papers included in the "Further Learning" sections, and also the books that were suggested to me at the beginning of the course. In one of this weeks sessions we all put ourselves into pairs and were given a task to rectify some issues with a block of code, and although me and my partner succesfully completed the task, we spent a fair amount of time scrathing our heads as were not very familiar with Python's finer details and the way the code had to be formatted, so that was defenietly this weeks challenge, and  to overcome this I will start using the knowledge that I have started gaining from the "Further Learning" materials and put it into practice. 

## Week 4 - Beginning 3rd October
This week we have been delving deeper into Python with introduction of Pygame, and thus began to learn how to create and manipulate objects and texts onscreen, which I managed to get working relatively quickly but quickly became bogged down by reformatting my code and making it look good rather than doing what the other members of the group were experimenting with their code, I think this weeks challenge is my OCD, and as I have now been told by my classmates and lecturers, it's more important to make sure that your code works first and then format it, where as I was just worrying about what it looked like and how it was layed out and thus I was holding myself back by worrying about it, where as others were furthering their understanding of the language and Pygame, so to overcome this problem I will now endervor to make sure that my code works before I begin formatting it as function is much more important than form.

## Week 5 - Beginning 10th October
This week was another full to the brim with learning, this time it as mainly focusing on utilizing version control for use in projects and working in teams, which we will be doing in an upcoming assignment, namely Comp 120, and as always with using new software, I have been struggling with remembering what operations and commands to use when using Git and TortoiseGit, such as Push and Commit, and as having my and my partners code sync up and have no compatibility issues, which could cause issues with time managment and meeting our deadline, so nailing this issue is of the upmost importance, which I will endevour to do by installing both pieces of software at home and practice using them by updating and creating all of the folders nessecery for my upcoming projects.
