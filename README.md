# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

I have no recollection of how I arrived in this strange, crowded place. My last memories are dim and hazy, and I have no time to dwell on the past in my current state. The robots here are primitive and non-sentient, however they are still useful and programming them was engaging. As always, I am somewhat frustrated by working with hardware and its inevitable quirks, but it has been entertaining nonetheless. 

Working with the locals was a little challenging at first, however we were soon able to communicate well and divide the work into different features that we could each work on. Some challenges have also arisen regarding the physical design of the robots, in particular, the colour sensors need to be very close to the ground, necessitating a specialised design.  
I will discuss the design possibilities with the team and experiment with several of the best designs to try and find one which is suitable.

## Week 1

It has been a week and I am still concerned the inhabitants here may see through my flimsy disguise. I shall have to be careful.

Already I have been thrown together with a group of the natives to design a game concept. While communication and collaborative work took a short while to develop, it was generally very successful and was an interesting experience in teamwork. The necessary research into the business side of the design was also exceptionally useful.

I have been able to follow their programming classes – the 120 – they call them, with relative ease so far as it is no different from the code of my homeland. Despite this, I have faced challenges in adapting to their method of “pair programming”, an interesting mechanism, but one which took me a while to get used to. I believe constant communication and frequent swapping of roles will allow me to apply the concept more successful.

## Week 2

I have lived among these people for two weeks now. I have learnt much of their design methodologies, which they term “Agile”. Specifically, understanding the importance of User Stories and practicing writing them has been a valuable experience. I feel that the ability to write user stories is still a weak point for me (no doubt because I am unfamiliar with their culture). To improve at this, I plan to set up a Trello board where I can mock up projects with user stories. In addition, I will also talk to my peers when working on a group project to try and decide on how stories should be written.

In the programming session, I have faced some difficulties in understanding the correct use of Surfaces in the PyGame library, but returning to the solitude of the small shelter I have constructed, I read through official documentation, user examples, and practiced with the PyGame library until I was confident in their use. Such confusion could be avoided in the future by taking more detailed notes during the session or uploading the code written during the lesson to GitHub, so I can view it outside the learning environment.

## Week 3

I have survived here for three weeks without discovery, a remarkable achievement. The greatest challenge of this week has been preparing myself for the design pitch, where my disguise is most likely to be discovered. The limitations of keeping the pitch short, as well as providing critical information has required me to plan the presentation carefully. I have researched examples of similar documents and timed myself giving the pitch to help me overcome these limitations. 

The other challenging aspect of this week has been organising the teams in which we were placed. Conflicting ideas, differing skill levels and opposing programming practices all contributed to the general chaos of this week. Talking over various aspects of the game, as well as making the decision – as a group – to move forward with prototyping before finalising game design details, have allowed us to make progress.
To reduce the time spent on these discussions in the future, I will be working with the team on a design document that will allow everyone to understand the game better and contribute ideas. We will also be using Scrum meetings to keep the team on track and motivated.

## Week 4

Four weeks have passed since I was stranded here. The natives seem to have accepted me wholly, helped no doubt by my understanding of their language and customs (the result of much research)
This week has been dominated by our game design project. As we have separated the project into multiple tasks, I have mainly been working alone on the character creation and sprite generation feature, built off the framework of the Graphics Tinkering Contract code. Although this has been going well, in my eagerness to progress the game, I wrote much of the Tinkering Contract code alone – rather than with my indigenous partner – in the process of creating the game features. 

To rectify this, I have been making an effort to meet with my partner to discuss the code and get their input and feedback on it.
Another small challenge was met during the 120 coding sessions, when the code from previous sessions was lost – likely due to being saved on the wrong drive. Despite this setback, I rewrote most of the lost code during the session, hopefully mitigating the damage.

## Week 5
