## Week 1


Overall the challenge I faced was trying to work effectively
as a team with a group of people I didnâ€™t know very well to complete the Lego
challenges, this however became easier throughout the week as I had more time
to spend with each person and we spent time getting to know each other better
allowing us to work more effectively as a team. Another challenge I faced was
that while programming one of the challenges it was hard to gauge how many
rotations the robot should be turning to get it to the exact position it needed
to be, to overcome this I did multiple tests to make sure it was in the right
position.


## Week 2


One challenge I faced during the week was trying to use the git
hub program as it is not something that I have ever used before so there was a
bit of a learning curve in how to fork a repository and then upload work to the
forked repository and then creating a pull request however to overcome this
challenge I used the internet to look up how to use the software so that that I
could correctly upload my work to the correct git hub repository and what all
of the different terms used in the git hub software.


## Week 3


I feel like I have progressed over the past two weeks as I
am getting a better grasp on the different modules and how they link together with
each other. One challenge I faced throughout the week was writing the
pseudocode for the fallout 4 mini-game in a way that anyone who would read the
code would understand, to overcome this I compared different examples of
pseudocode from different places to try and make it readable universally.
Another challenge I faced was when creating the paper prototype for the Bull
game trying to represent it in a way that would be true to how it would be on
screen, to overcome this we worked as a team to try out different ways we could
present the information.


## Week 4


One challenge that I faced was when I was designing the
concept for the video game was trying to create something original that could
be targeted at an already existing target audience while still making the game
easy to make with an interesting premise, to overcome this I took inspiration
from other video games to help shape what the gameplay and story would be and
how different elements such as the music and the art style would change the
look and feel of the game. It was also then turning those ideas into visual
representations and describing them in a pitch.
