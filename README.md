## Week 1
LEGO robot Olympics, we built and programmed simple tasks with LEGO robots, then programmed them to complete challenges in the second week. My group won because we practised each task repeatedly, the only task we didn’t repeat we failed this taught me the importance of testing.

## Week 2
Game concepts design, we worked on producing a board game for a certain demographic then pitch our design to the rest of the class, our first attempt was very confusing as everyone’s ideas didn’t match, I also learnt the importance of playing your prototype to find and repair problems before pitching.

## Week 3
Agile game development, I was absent for the morning practical lesson, and learnt about Agile in the afternoon lecture.

## Week 4
Game version control, using TortoiseGit, in groups we had to create the PONG game by transferring Pycharm files between computers, I didn’t transfer any files so therefor didn’t learn how to use TortoiseGit, and barely new any coding to help build PONG.

## Week 5
Presenting to game Designers, I spent ages making sprites and nice text boxes to present my game, then on the day I couldn’t show anyone my handout and I forgot all my information and presenting my game me extreme anxiety problems, I learnt that I should stay away from presenting and always expect the worse.
