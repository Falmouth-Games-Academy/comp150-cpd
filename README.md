# comp150-cpd

## Week 1

# This week has been useful as a reintroduction to working, after taking a break over the Christmas holidays. Particularly the lecture at the beggining of the week to remind us of good and bad programming practices and work practices. The unreal workshops on Friday were also very useful in helping me to familiarise myself with the engine and begin to learn how to program using blueprints.

# Over this week I was not very productive, additionally I wasn't very productive in the time over Christmas. In future it I need to use my free time more effectivley and productivley. Especially when I have a large amount of it such as a holiday. 

## Week 2

# During this week I have managed to practice c++ signifigantly to become familiar with the language. The workshop at the beggining of this week has been very helpful in allowing me to practice my c++ to become familiar with it. The unreal session on Friday was also very useful in helping me further my understanding of blueprints and how to work with them in order to make interesting game functions such as launchpads and lights that can be turned off and on. 

# During this week however I have not downloaded unreal to my own personal computer. This has meant that I have not been able to practice much that I have been working on in the studio at home. In the very near future I will download unreal to my computer. In the distant future it would be good working practice to have all software I will be working with installed onto an easily accesible computer so that I can regularly practice from home. 

## Week 3 

# Over this week I have mostly been working on blueprints for the collaborative game working with the BA students. Monday's lecture was very interesting and was for the most part new to me as it covered class inheritance and relationships, which is something I have not done before.

# While the topics covered during lectures were interseting my understanding of them is quite vauge. To help my understanding I should read back over the session slides and my own personal notes to help further my understanding of these topics. 

## Week 4 

# The lecture this week was very interesting. While some things taught some people would have realised from our previous work with pygame. However the level of depth the lecture went into far exceeded what could have been extrapolated from previous lessons and workshops and was extremley interesting. Additionally the differences between the two engines being explained helped to explain the differences between how the engines work. However there was a lot of information to take in, making it quite difficult to gain a secure understanding of all the topics covered during the lecture.

## Week 5 

# The guest lecture this week on computational creativity was extremely interesting. The ideas raised and projects shown to us helped to give new inspiration to the capabilities of computing. However it's also difficult to see how we would apply these ideologies to our current work, or work we may have in the near future. The introduction to databases was a nice reintroduction to databases, as I brifely used databases for my a level computing coursework, and helped me to get refamiliar with SQL code again. It was also an informal lesson on how databases are used in games and what sort of data can be stored by games companies. 

## Week 6 

# This weeks's workshop on databases was an interesting, however it was difficult to set up due to the requirments of amazon's database system. Additionally the tutorial given to us was not very good at teaching us what we were doing. Rather it just told us what to do and we did as it said. In future I would like to have time to look at what we were doing rather than just doing it. For the group project I have been working on re making the combat system which has been put in place. It was simplistic before and was very awkward to use. Having reworked it, it is now a lot smoother and easier to use, although it could still be improved upon. 

## Week 7

# Tuesday's lecture on databases was good for finalising the week's before tasks. This time around it was easier to set up from looking at others and how they set up their databases. However it still felt as though we were just following a tutorial rather than learning what we were doing. For the group project I have been working on how the player deals damage to enemies and getting enemies to respawn. This hasn't been particularly difficult, thanks to blueprints, however it was still time consuming. 

## Week 8 

# This week I've mostly been concentrating on work for the group game. I've worked on implementing a scoring system, as well as making a new area for the player to choose their weapon. Most days have been very productive in this regard, although the show and tell day was less productive. The show and tell day was a good chance to see everyone elses games and gain inspiration for future games. 

## Week 9

# TODO

## Key skills to improve

## 1 Revision of topics covered in lectures

# One of my greatest weaknesses is that I quickly forget a lot of work covered in lectures. While I have improved dramatically with note taking I do not go any further to gain greater understanding of what has been taught during a lecture. For example I do not go back over my notes and I do not read papers related to the topic of the lecture. I also find it is difficult to remember a lot of what is taught because it is not particualy applicable to a lot of the work we are currently doing. This would be useful to me for my future because it would help to deepen my understanding of computing and software principles, which would in turn help me to become a more competent programmer. While certain topics may not be relevant now the topics bought up may be useful to me in the future, which is why it is important to commit as much of what is taugt to memory as possible. 

## 2 Communication/leadership skills

# During the last few months teamwork has been really essential to the group project we have been given. At the beginning of the project my communication with the team was very minimal and I was unwilling to take on tasks or communicate with my team about what tasks needed doing and I should be working on. Over the last few weeks I have improved my communication within the team hugely. I now ensure that I communicate with my team the work that I have done and try to start conversations about how we should implement certain features. However I would like to improve on my leadership skills and further improve my communication. During this project I was not very involved in the design of the game or in working with other team members to implement functions or assets. It would be useful for me to learn how to take on a leadership role for two reasons: 1) It allows me to appriciate a leader's choices and to better respect their decisions. 2) It means that I will be more capable of taking on a leadership role in future group projects and in professional environments.

## 3 Reading around the subject

# Another cause of weakness in my knowledge is due to my lack of reading around the subject. While I often look at articles and online posts about computing and hardware, I often find it difficult to sit down and read a whole paper as they are usually long and often difficult to understand. This is very important for someone working in a computing environment as scientific papers often showcase the most advanced and upcoming technologies. As computing is a fast paced field and is often devleoping it is important to keep up with developments so that it is possible to use and implement others knowledge.
