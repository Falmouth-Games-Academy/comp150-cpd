# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report
*You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to.*  

*This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.*

## Week 0 (September 18th 2017)
This week I participated in the Robot Olympiad. It was tough.

The first problem was a lack of task setting. At first, no one knew what to do, as one member took the robot and began independently piecing it together. This initiated an ongoing lack of concurrent productivity as others wondered what to do.

The second problem was team communication. Many creative, technical, and practical suggestions made to him were shot down or debated hotly. I lost motivation and felt useless. He had predetermined what would work and what wouldn’t, and deflected all input.

I wanted to experiment and contribute. But my interests weren’t of value to the team. However, the product still was.

To counter this problem in the future, I will speak more confidently with a more product-focused approach. Teammates who don’t know each other have a common interest: the product. Next time I’m faced with a lack of contribution opportunity, I’ll ask, ‘what do you from this robot,’ followed by ‘then I’ll help achieve it with [x task]’, where x is a useful non-blocking task and justifiable as I have no other assigned jobs. This direct form of communication should revive motivation and improve the product.

## Week 1 (September 25th 2017)
This week I worked in a team to produce a game concept. It was another disaster in team communication.

Following an initial conceptualisation session, which was bumpy as we had no method to manage conflicting ideas, the team parted ways without sharing contact details. This created a multitude of problems. When in a new team, I will ensure contact is arranged before we part ways next time.

I managed to recover the team by creating a Discord server and creating shoutouts on Slack. This and contact links between other members slowly brought the team online. After Nathan and Adrian first arrived, we arranged a studio meeting to solidify the designs, with success.

But during work period, work wasn’t being done, and when it was, it wasn’t communicated. There was no workflow, so in the weekend I arranged a scrum workflow, but it was too late, and some members didn’t understand it--they weren’t online. By Sunday I’d not only expended a lot of personal energy working on the specifications, but was criticised for taking too much of the work.

Much of this could have been avoided with better contact. Next time contact details will be shared and an initial meeting arranged.

## Week 2 (October 2nd 2017)
This week I worked solo to produce a game concept. I worked hard and was confident in the idea, but sadly it was unpopular across the board.

Let’s start off with the bad. My time management was off point. I spent too many hours trying to pass the SpaceChem assignment to a ‘professional’ level, hating every moment of it, falling short by one symbol. From now I will try to prioritise work, to favour more productive or highly-marked assignments by doing those first.

I had time to work all weekend on the concept. I went to the library to select a concept, develop the game in a quiet environment, and produce a decent amount of inspired work. Moving to a new environment helped me stay focused as I spewed my ideas onto calcium-carbonate-coated sheets of pure tree.

I can’t easily fix having outlandish and unpopular ideas, but I could try and condense them more. Unfortunately my feedback stated that a similar game already existed. Understandable, pure genius is usually fashionably late. However my pitch went overtime, which I could mitigate by rehearsing, which I could do by not spending hours aggressively mashing SpaceChem particles, so I have more time left.

## Week 3 (October 9th 2017)
This week I worked with Tomas on pair programming. It’s going fine, but internally it's rough due to my extensive experience. It tests my patience--I must always slow down.

This introduced the first issue - stressing him out. I correct mistakes very quickly. Repeatedly correcting him, though constructively and with rationale, took a toll on his confidence. He sometimes seemed tired, uncomfortable or quiet. Meanwhile I’m conscious of hindering his hands-on learning when giving the answers, or being patronising and unhelpful when allowing him his own time to work something out. I get stressed out too.

But we get along well. He explained he beats himself up over things like that. Working under the critical eyes of someone more experienced is hard, unless they’re a teacher. On the bright side, I’m learning more about communicating critique and he is learning more about code. Recently he is correcting me on my mistakes more than before, which means he’s getting experience, and that I’m approachable to him, which makes me more comfortable.

How to improve: take more regular breaks during studio practice. Evidently, we can work together, but stress is sometimes too high. Take a 10-min break per 45-mins, go outside, chat, coffee.


## Week 4 (October 16th 2017)
This week we kicked off some actual development. The team’s good. I'm confident. We gonna make sum gamez!

Timekeeping has been good. We all know when we’re meeting up and the meetings have happened on time with no absences. Stand-ups ensure we all play a part.

Negotiating with Beren however is a challenge--we have differences in opinions with the code. Vitally he sometimes changes my and Tomas’ code without a review. Granted, he has taken the responsibility of bringing the code modules together, but I'm precious about code, and while his rationale is often strong--and I’ve adapted accordingly--some of the modifications were undue, possibly unnecessary. My rationale isn’t always smart, but that's for the team to decide during review. I expect this’ll also result in merge conflicts. I raised my concerns on the spot but haven’t convinced him. As I continue working--to avoid wasting time--I’m failing to convey my viewpoint to the team.

I plan to discuss this at the next contractor meeting. My goal is to clarify and ensure we have a proper review strategy in place that favours a team consensus on coding choices. I'll also emphasise my discomfort in my code being changed without permission.
