# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

# Semester 1

## Week 0

I have no recollection of how I arrived in this strange, crowded place. My last memories are dim and hazy, and I have no time to dwell on the past in my current state. The robots here are primitive and non-sentient, however they are still useful and programming them was engaging. As always, I am somewhat frustrated by working with hardware and its inevitable quirks, but it has been entertaining nonetheless. 

Working with the locals was a little challenging at first, however we were soon able to communicate well and divide the work into different features that we could each work on. Some challenges have also arisen regarding the physical design of the robots, in particular, the colour sensors need to be very close to the ground, necessitating a specialised design.  
I will discuss the design possibilities with the team and experiment with several of the best designs to try and find one which is suitable.

## Week 1

It has been a week (by the light of the nearest star) and I am still concerned the inhabitants here may see through my flimsy disguise. I shall have to be careful.

Already I have been thrown together with a group of the natives to design a game concept. While communication and collaborative work took a short while to develop, it was generally very successful and was an interesting experience in teamwork. The necessary research into the business side of the design was also exceptionally useful.

I have been able to follow their programming classes – the 120 – they call them, with relative ease so far as it is no different from the code of my homeland. Despite this, I have faced challenges in adapting to their method of “pair programming”, an interesting mechanism, but one which took me a while to get used to. I believe constant communication and frequent swapping of roles will allow me to apply the concept more successful.

## Week 2

I have lived among these people for two weeks now. I have learnt much of their design methodologies, which they term “Agile”. Specifically, understanding the importance of User Stories and practicing writing them has been a valuable experience. I feel that the ability to write user stories is still a weak point for me (no doubt because I am unfamiliar with their culture). To improve at this, I plan to set up a Trello board where I can mock up projects with user stories. In addition, I will also talk to my peers when working on a group project to try and decide on how stories should be written.

In the programming session, I have faced some difficulties in understanding the correct use of Surfaces in the PyGame library, but returning to the solitude of the small shelter I have constructed, I read through official documentation, user examples, and practiced with the PyGame library until I was confident in their use. Such confusion could be avoided in the future by taking more detailed notes during the session or uploading the code written during the lesson to GitHub, so I can view it outside the learning environment.

## Week 3

I have survived here for three weeks without discovery, a remarkable achievement. The greatest challenge of this week has been preparing myself for the design pitch, where my disguise is most likely to be discovered. The limitations of keeping the pitch short, as well as providing critical information has required me to plan the presentation carefully. I have researched examples of similar documents and timed myself giving the pitch to help me overcome these limitations. 

The other challenging aspect of this week has been organising the teams in which we were placed. Conflicting ideas, differing skill levels and opposing programming practices all contributed to the general chaos of this week. Talking over various aspects of the game, as well as making the decision – as a group – to move forward with prototyping before finalising game design details, have allowed us to make progress.
To reduce the time spent on these discussions in the future, I will be working with the team on a design document that will allow everyone to understand the game better and contribute ideas. We will also be using Scrum meetings to keep the team on track and motivated.

## Week 4

Four weeks have passed since I was stranded here. The natives seem to have accepted me wholly, helped no doubt by my understanding of their language and customs (the result of much research)
This week has been dominated by our game design project. As we have separated the project into multiple tasks, I have mainly been working alone on the character creation and sprite generation feature, built off the framework of the Graphics Tinkering Contract code. Although this has been going well, in my eagerness to progress the game, I wrote much of the Tinkering Contract code alone – rather than with my indigenous partner – in the process of creating the game features. 

To rectify this, I have been making an effort to meet with my partner to discuss the code and get their input and feedback on it.
Another small challenge was met during the 120 coding sessions, when the code from previous sessions was lost – likely due to being saved on the wrong drive. Despite this setback, I rewrote most of the lost code during the session, hopefully mitigating the damage.

## Week 5

As I write, it has been more than a month by the standards of this far flung rock and help shows no sign of appearing. Most of this week has been spent focusing on the game project where I have made progress on cleaning up and documenting the character creation code. Our first coding assignment, was also due this week, so some time was spent refactoring it to be neater and more modular.

Some challenges have occurred during our game project, the most prominent being the lack of a unified structure to the game onto which individuals can build features. This has slowed us down by necessitating that people write their own code for things that should be an integral part of the game, for example, rendering the game window.

To remedy this, we will be working on a core framework as a team. This framework should primarily consist of the game loop, into which people can plug their code. In addition, we will write an overview of the classes that need to be written and the functions that they should perform, after which people can choose classes to write, building up a library of relevant methods for the game.

## Week 6

The past week has been a studio week where we could work in our own time on our game project. Despite the intended focus on game development, I ended up spending a lot of time working on the two essays we had as they were due fairly soon. Trying to balance essay writing and programming was the biggest challenge this week.  

Doing more preliminary researching and drafting of the essays would have made this easier, as well as having a set day(s) each week to do a small amount of work on each essay so that they progressed gradually rather than requiring a lot of time to complete.  

It was also during this time that I got bored of writing these journal entries as post-crash logs of an intergalactic explorer. There are only so many synonyms for “natives” and “planet”.


## Week 7

This week has also consisted mainly of essay writing; however I have also made an effort to do some work on the game, mainly touching up small pieces of code and documentation here and there.  

Concerning essay writing, the biggest challenge has been finding enough (and relevant enough) references to support the arguments I make. Comparing references with peers could be one way to find new references, as papers often overlap certain areas and can be relevant to multiple arguments. Looking at the sources references by each reference I currently have would also be useful, as they are often related to the same subject as paper referencing them.


## Week 8

This week we peer reviewed essays which was an interesting experience. I find skim-reading the essays fairly easy and I can judge the more concrete rubric categories – such as structure, grammar and referencing – quickly. However, the more abstract categories including Depth of Insight and Analysis are more difficult for me to make judgements on.  

Simply having more practice at peer reviews will probably make me more comfortable with the process but comparing my marking to other people’s marking and judgements could also help me understand how certain categories are marked.


## Week 9
The pitch for our game was the main event of this week and had the team working hard over the weekend to finalise as much as possible. Overall the pitch was fairly decent, especially as we managed to get a working prototype of the game that could be demonstrated. On the other hand, the presentation itself was much less polished and could have be vastly improved.   

The marketing and sales section was added very late in the process and therefore had not had as much research put into it as it should have, as well as the team not having had much practice at rehearsing the presentation. Next time we have to do a pitch, the business aspect should be a large focus for us and we should also ensure that we have all had at least one or two rehearsals.


## Week 10

This week my programming partner and I focused on finishing the Audio Tinkering assignment and tried to find ways to make it stand out. We ended up going for the whimsical idea of representing the sound as a colour, hoping this would add some flair and creativity to the project.  

Although we were able to complete the assignment and implement most of our colour-based quirk, we did not have enough time for the coup de grace, the finished, mixed colour that would represent the sound. This could certainly make our choice of user interface seem somewhat odd at best, and obfuscating at worst.  

The greatest challenge for me on this project was my lack of audio knowledge. It was only due to my partner’s extensive experience with audio that we managed to make an interesting program. Researching audio programming and understanding the theory behind it would make programming it far less complex for me.


## Week 11

This was the week in which we started learning to use the Unreal Engine. Using Unreal on the University’s computers is rather like what I imagine Sisyphus must experience, albeit with crashes, sluggish loading and permission errors in place of gravity.  

Despite this it was interesting to work with C++ and to experiment with UE4. Coming to grips with C++’s class/header format was challenging but not impossible. I also spent some time outside of lectures looking at possible ways to implement our game idea with UE4. Further practice with C++ and looking at example code will help me become more comfortable with this format.


## Week 12

Our new group game pitches took place this week and were the focus of our attentions. Although only the BA students were being assessed in this pitch, my fellow BSc’s and I took part in the planning of the pitch and also took speaking roles in it.  

Getting all the information necessary into the short time frame we were given was difficult but manageable. We gave almost everyone a speaking role and delivered the pitch well. However, we could have done more research into some of the technical areas of the game.  

Finalising the core mechanics of the game early on would have helped us with this as we continued to change the core mechanics up until close to the pitch which didn’t give us much time to thoroughly research the programming needed to implement the proposed features.  

I feel like I should do something special to mark the end of a term. Poem?  

Coding is great, but the essays are dry,  
The computers are slow, all heave a sigh,  
Self-teaching is fine, while you walk the line,  
But chance to dine, with the sun in the sky,  
And you’ll find that the end is more than quite nigh  



# Semseter 2

## Week 1
This first week has been fairly unorganised, which is somewhat to be expected. We made the decision to work exclusively on Tomas’ prototype, which has given us all a base to build on. I think the biggest problem our team is encountering (which was also encountered when we original met to concept ideas) is a lack of creative direction and leadership. While we have good artists, designers, etc, there is no one to codify important aspects such as aesthetic or tone.  

It’s not the biggest problem we could face, but I do feel that there isn’t much of a consensus among the team as to the creative direction the game should go in. As a programmer I am reluctant to try and step in and take creative control, especially as I know little about this area, but I do think that in the future, we should designate some sort of artistic director to ensure a degree of unity in our art style.

## Week 2
I have spent this week working on implementing a shooter enemy character, as our game seems to be leaning more towards a bullet-hell style of gameplay. With my limited programming experience (especially in Unreal) I have found myself largely working of the existing codebase, mostly creating subclasses and adding small functions here and there. Although this is appropriate in this instance, I feel that my capacity for original contribution to the project is fairly low. I plan to expand the classes I have made more to gain a better understanding of  blueprints and the Unreal engine. 

## Week 3
I haven’t done as much work on the game project as I would like this week, as I’m still unfamiliar with unreal and find it difficult to implement what appear to be simple features, such as enemy movement and shooting. I have however tackled the big SVN issues we’ve been having, with help from Brian. As none of us have used SVN before - and only a few of us have used version control at all – using SVN has been a stumbling block for the team in these past few weeks.   

Errors, conflicts and lost work have slowed development and I think some of the team find it disheartening. I sat down with Brian and we worked through the various issues (unversioned files that should be versioned, folders wrongly added to SVN, merge conflicts, etc.) until the server was in working condition, and much, much cleaner. This has shown me how important it is to spend the time to correctly set up version control, and also the need to make sure everyone on the team understands how to use it, and how to deal with common problems.

## Week 4
One of my first goals this week was to remove the redundant unreal projects from our SVN server, as we had had three different projects all versioned, making pulling from the server very slow. This poor project structure came about due to our early prototyping methods and a lack of definitive management of the SVN server. Perhaps a weekly review of the project and file structure could have helped alleviate this?  

Aside from this, I continued to work on shooting enemies, having no made much progress last week. I added a new controller to make them face towards the player while shooting. This brought a host of new problems and bugs with it which I have been working through. I also created two subclasses of projectile to differentiate between player and enemy projectiles. However, this highlighted an issue with our development process when I had to explain how the new projectile classes worked. We never designed an overall architecture, or rough layout of the systems, instead we have been improvising new classes whenever they are needed. 
This has made our development somewhat chaotic. I feel that a greater level of communication between the programmers – perhaps in the form of a weekly review of each other’s code - would help reduce the confusion caused by our lack of planning. 

## Week 5
The first half of this week has been focused on research for the software engineering essay, mainly using the university library and IEEE websites. One of the problems I encountered during this research was the lack of scholarly articles directly addressing the video games industry. It seems that a vast majority of the papers on software engineering practices are aimed towards enterprise software development and even those that do relate to the games industry, often only do so in passing. Because of this, it has been challenging to find the information I need to directly answer my research question.  

The rest of the week I have spent working on the game, mainly adding small features such as the ability to toggle the shield on and off. I feel limited by my poor understanding of unreal and its features, as well as finding blueprint’s somewhat confusing to work in. This has made me unconfident in creating large features or systems for the game, as I tend to waste time on small errors and researching simple problems. I think that only practice will really help improve this, and possibly working on personal Unreal projects at home would help to solidify my understanding.

## Week 6
Preparation for the show and tell day has dominated this week, as we wanted to improve the game as much as possible while also getting the necessary trailer and presentation created. There wasn’t much organisation in our team regarding the preparation. There were certainly some communication issues as both our animator and I ended up making cinematics for the trailer.   

Most of my time this week was spent creating the trailer using the Unreal sequencer and camera tracks. Unfortunately, on the Friday of the hand-in, only a handful of team members turned up, so a lot of responsibility fell on my fellow programmer Louis and I. Despite this, we managed to pull together the cinematics, gameplay footage, music and last-minute voice acting to complete the trailer. 

## Week 7
This has mainly been a week of practice and rehearsal. With two presentations (the software engineering research and the show and tell day) approaching, the majority of my time was spent preparing for these. Because the slides for the show and tell day were completed fairly late, we didn’t have time to edit them as much as I would have liked. This led to some timing issues that required a lot of practice and trial and error to get right.   

The actual show and tell went better than expected, however we did run out of time for the full presentation, even though we had been able to present within the time during rehearsals. In future, I will err on the side of finishing too early when I plan a presentation, as there are numerous variables that can and likely will make the real one take longer than expected.

## Week 8 
Due to the software engineering essay, I didn’t spend a huge amount of time on the group game project this week. Mainly, I looked at creating a child of the triggerBox class that was designed to be assigned a dialogue script that will then be played when the box is triggered. 

At the request of our writer who is working on the dialogue, I initially planned to make the triggerBox freeze the player’s movement until the dialogue had finished. However, as this was a little more complex than I had initially thought, and we don’t have long left, I decided to work on more vital areas of the game instead. Having to balance realistic goals with the requests of the team has been one of the more common challenges I have faced.

## Week 9
I spent most of my time replacing the default Unreal model with the new one this week. I also had to quickly learn about how to implement animations via animation blueprints and create one for the player.
Although this worked out fine, I feel that it could have been beneficial for our animator to have learnt how to do this, (perhaps we could have sat down together and worked it out) as this would allow him to add his own animations to the models – a fairly non-technical task – which would free me up to deal with more programming-related issues. I definitely could have taken the initiative to teach him what I was learning about animation blueprints which would also have given him a valuable skill for his later projects.  

However, this was something of a trend among the non-programmers; a reluctance to get involved with any “code” or “programming”, deferring all technical issues to the programmers. In our next project, I think that making sure everyone has a basic understanding of the engine and how to program very simple elements would help everyone be more comfortable with being more independent.

## Week 10
Working on the controller game, the biggest challenge I faced was realising that the 3-axis accelerometer I was using could not be used to calculate yaw (only roll and pitch) without additional sensors. Earlier in development, I had noticed issues with yaw calculations, but not paid much attention to it as 1. Yaw movement worked enough in my very rough tests for me to put it down to “working but needs more precision” and 2. Once I had the vague ability to control the game, there were much larger issues that needed to be tackled such as collision and shooting.  

I also feel that my general lack of interest in the hardware side of the project may have contributed to me focusing on the programming, rather than perfecting the controller. To deal with the yaw issue, I simply moved the sensor from the chair to the user’s body. This allowed me to use roll in place of yaw for my movement detection. This was a simple and lazy fix, but I didn’t have time for a more sophisticated approach. In the future, paying more attention to the assignment brief (working controller) over personal preference (software and programming) would have allowed me to identify this issue earlier and find a better solution.

## Week 11
With the two big deadlines over, this week has been fairly relaxed. In addition to working on the CPD assignment, I have also given thought to our summer world building assignment, after the lecture detailing it. This is a very interesting project, especially as it steps outside the usual scope of our programming course, and I think that giving people the chance to plan and possibly influence their game from this early stage could help to build excitement and investment in the games – something that was lacking in our team for this year’s group project.
