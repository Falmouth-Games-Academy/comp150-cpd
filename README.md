## Week 1- Beginning 26th September

With this being my first "proper" week at University, I am now beginning to become accustomed with the finer details and workings of how my course and the overall establishment operate and what it expects of me, and my first meeting with my personal tutor really helped to cement this. Having completed several group activities with other members of my course, such as the Lego Mindstorms challenge last week, and several board game activities this week, along with the first programming task, I feel much more comfortable talking and interacting with other members of my group, as I normally find it hard to interface with new people but I really feel these activites helped me feel a lot more comfortable.
