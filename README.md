## Week 1


One challenge that I faced during the week was trying to get
my code for the hacking minigame functional while keeping it maintainable and
coherent, I found that it was small bits of code stopped the entire program
from working. One way I worked to fix this was using pair programming with
someone else to make sure all of the code was present and correct. This helped
pick up on my small mistakes in the coding. This also saved me time rather than
looking through all of the code multiple times to try and find the specific
issues in the game.

## Week 2


One challenge I faced during the week was trying to create
UML Use-Case diagrams and UML Class diagrams as it is not a language I commonly
use in my work however to rectify this I re-read the tutorial documentation to
make sure I have a better grasp on how the diagrams look and how they
effectively function to describe the design of software. This allowed me to
create UML documentation based off of our game Ragnarök Station. Doing this
made it easier to see how different aspects of the game work and how the work
together to make one complete game.

## Week 3


One challenge that I faced over the past week was learning
how to use getters and setters in terms of access control and how to apply this
to different values that I am currently working with in my game. To fix this I
looked at unreal tutorials to find out how this was done in the Unreal 4
Engine, I then applied this knowledge to different parts in my game such as
setting up a pause menu for the player to use in game. I then attempted to give
this menu the correct functionality that would be expected in a normal video
game.

## Week 4


One challenge that I faced this week was getting my head
around time steps, interpolation and substepping, to fix this I went over the
session slides for the lecture and made sure I knew the difference between the
three and how they all have different uses problems such as how variable time
step will fluctuate and isn’t completely accurate due to floating point
numbers, how interpolation tries to fix jerky movement by rendering in-between
updates and how substepping tries to be the best of both fixed and variable
time steps. I then tried to implement this knowledge into my game project.
