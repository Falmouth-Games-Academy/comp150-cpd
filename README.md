# comp150-cpd

## Week 1

# This week has been useful as a reintroduction to working, after taking a break over the Christmas holidays. Particularly the lecture at the beggining of the week to remind us of good and bad programming practices and work practices. The unreal workshops on Friday were also very useful in helping me to familiarise myself with the engine and begin to learn how to program using blueprints.

# Over this week I was not very productive, additionally I wasn't very productive in the time over Christmas. In future it I need to use my free time more effectivley and productivley. Especially when I have a large amount of it such as a holiday. 

## Week 2

# During this week I have managed to practice c++ signifigantly to become familiar with the language. The workshop at the beggining of this week has been very helpful in allowing me to practice my c++ to become familiar with it. The unreal session on Friday was also very useful in helping me further my understanding of blueprints and how to work with them in order to make interesting game functions such as launchpads and lights that can be turned off and on. 

# During this week however I have not downloaded unreal to my own personal computer. This has meant that I have not been able to practice much that I have been working on in the studio at home. In the very near future I will download unreal to my computer. In the distant future it would be good working practice to have all software I will be working with installed onto an easily accesible computer so that I can regularly practice from home. 

## Week 3 

# Over this week I have mostly been working on blueprints for the collaborative game working with the BA students. Monday's lecture was very interesting and was for the most part new to me as it covered class inheritance and relationships, which is something I have not done before.

# While the topics covered during lectures were interseting my understanding of them is quite vauge. To help my understanding I should read back over the session slides and my own personal notes to help further my understanding of these topics.
