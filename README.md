# comp150-cpd

## Week 1
The first week is the week we met our classmates for the first time. Eventually we started working on a LEGO robot, where half of the team would assemble the robot itself while the other half programmed it to complete the various tasks that were given. A challenge I encountered was generally getting to know and communicate with each other, which is something I've been struggling with for longer than I'd like to admit. To improve on this, getting to know my surroundings and people should prove beneficial.  

## Week 2
This week, we practiced game ideation and applying them on paper. The challenge we faced involved using too much time and effort on the ideation itself and less on the working prototype. We addressed this by halting time spent on the ideation and more towards the working prototype, which we ended up completing right before demonstrating it to the class. 

## Week 3
This week we worked on designing another paper prototype for a text-based game, although in different groups. One of the two challenges I faced was adapting to a new group of people and putting myself out there. The other challenge was coming up with realistic ideas for the the prototype, as we became too ambitious at times. To address these, continuing getting to know each other should be helpful, as well as learning to narrow down ideas in order to avoid stretching them more than they need to be. 

## Week 4
This week, logic gates and computing memory were shown and explained to us, as well as tinkering-graphics related topics. The only challenge was focusing and understanding said topics in the lectures. I will address this by going over the appropriate slides again.

## Week (?)
In this lecture, we learned about the agile philosophy and how it is applied in SCRUM. In addition, we made a product backlog and a sprint task board using Trello. The major challenge was actually figuring out how each of these worked both alone and together. While they will still take some time to get used to, they have become easier to understand after playing around with them. 

## Week (?)
During this lecture, we learned how to apply graphics -- such as printing "Hello world!" with different background colours. The challenging part was the actual application of said graphics, as I was quite uncertain on what you really had to type in order to get your wanted results. I overcame this challenge by reading the tutorial guides on pygame's website, and by taking a peek at the code that was submitted on Slack by other students to further understand and analyse what I was actually implementing. 

## Week (?)
During our Comp-110 lecture this week, we were introduced to object oriented programming. The live coding example was proven useful, however I still have to learn what's actually going on in the code and why certain pieces of code are placed in their locations. Moreover, two more challenges I encountered this week were trying to understand the 3rd research paper - since it involved quite a bit of math -, and creating a research question for my agile essay. To address these, I will revisit the paper again to get a better grasp over it and do some more agile-development research for my research question.

## Week (?)
This week I was faced with a challenge of deciding a research question for my agile essay and preparing a presentation about it. I had a few vague ideas regarding that, although it was later revealed that I needed to construct a more specific question. Eventually, I decided to present my essay slides privately to my tutor, as I am generally not confident with presenting in front of other people, mostly due to my speaking/oral skills since English isn't exactly my native language. Despite all this, I eventually managed to construct a more specific question with help from my tutor for my agile essay. I will also practice my presentation skills more in order for me to improve both my confidence and oral skills.

## Week 8
This week we were had our sprint review for our comp-150 desktop game. This was our first session in a while where all the team members were present, which led to our productive time in improving and coming up with different ideas for our game. We all took turns and did pair-programming during this lecture, which I thought was helpful and provided clarity. A challenge we were eventually faced with was our Trello board, which wasn't specific enough and contained user stories that weren't thoroughly explained. Improving our user stories by adding more depth and descriptions to them should be the way to go in terms of addressing this challenge.

## Week 12
This week we took part in various viva sessions. A challenge I was faced with was properly explaining what my lines of code did, which could be greatly improved. After the viva sessions, my group member and I started pair programming our tinkering-audio project where we decided on adding a decay function, although with minimal help in order for me to understand what the audio code did. While my group member did a great job at explaining parts of the code, it still took a good few hours for me to properly understand and implement the required lines. Going over the tinkering-audio slides and getting a little more hands-on with it should be considered.
