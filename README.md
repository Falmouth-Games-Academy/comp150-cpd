## Week 1
LEGO robot Olympics, we built and programmed simple tasks with LEGO robots, then programmed them to complete challenges in the second week. My group won because we practised each task repeatedly, the only task we didn’t repeat we failed, this taught me the importance of testing.

## Week 2
Game concepts design, we worked on producing a board game for a certain demographic then pitch our design to the rest of the class, our first attempt was very confusing as everyone’s ideas didn’t match, I also learnt the importance of playing your prototype to find and repair problems before pitching.

## Week 3
Agile game development, I was absent for the morning practical lesson, and learnt about Agile in the afternoon lecture.

## Week 4
Game version control, using TortoiseGit, in groups we had to create the PONG game by transferring Pycharm files between computers, I didn’t transfer any files so therefore didn’t learn how to use TortoiseGit, and barely new any coding to help build PONG. I have slowly learnt how to use TortoiseGit through my 120 tinkering graphics project.

## Week 5
Presenting to game Designers, I spent ages making sprites and nice text boxes to present my game, then on the day I couldn’t show anyone my handout and I forgot all my information, I learnt that I get very nervous during presentations and need more practise

##Week 6
Learnt how to use LaTex to write scholarly papers, which I found very difficult to understand, I will practise this in my own time and watch a tutorial to help.

##Week 7
Finally chose my Agile question and presented it to an Agile professional, presenting was a tiny bit better than last time, but still needs practise.

##Week 8
Was absent for monday and tuesday from flu, wednesday tinkering audio didn't understand any of the lectures and couldn't do the workshop, went over it with Michael understood it a bit better and realised I need to go over my maths again.

##Week 9
Finally made a start on collision for Slime Evo realised I have no idea what a class is and how to make one to track the sprites movement, Tinkering audio 2 couldn't follow any of the lectures must ask one of my tutors to explain it all to me again.

##Week 10
Agile peer review peer review, I found the main critisms from my peers was spelling and punctuation, with help from my dyslexic tutor I am slowly improving.

##Week 11
Tinkering audio peer review, because of my previous deadlines, I had commited nothing to github and completed no work towards this assignment, this shows I need to improve my time management in the future.

##Week 12
The desktop game hand in, collision was still acting the way it shouldn't, I should have managed my time better and asked my tutors to look over my code by making a pull request on github, which I will be taking advantage of next semester.
