# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

Met my class and had a lot of fun during the robot olympiad! It was a nice ice breaker and a taster of how teamwork in uni will play out. Everybody had a go and learned something from this experience. I already had some teamwork experience before though, so it wasn't anything that new. Although it was a bit different than all my previous experiences, because of the fact that I didn't know my teammates before, and have barely just met them. While working on our robots for the olympiade, I noticed that sometimes I am a bit stubborn, and I like to do my own thing, which might not always be beneficial to the team as a whole. I will keep in mind this behaviour and try to avoid pushing my own ideas so much in the future, and try to listen more to what my teammates want to do as well to come up with an optimal solution everyone would be happy with.

## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals

Uni started for real now. Met all the tutors, had a taste of how the lectures will play out during the week. Pretty excited for the PyGame project. Feeling like I'm gonna enjoy this. So far I'm very optimistic about this course, I feel like I'm gonna do well.

## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

Having a lot of fun playing around with python and experimenting with graphics. Also learning a lot of useful stuff about teamwork and management through the Agile lectures. I'm starting to notice some of the problems I have, mainly with time management. I feel like more knowledge of agile will be of help to me in the future. 

## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

Had a lot of fun coming up with my game concept, although the pitching part was pretty stressfull. Need to work on my social and public speaking skills a bit and get more comfortable with other people. Learned a lot about version control, noticed how useful it can be and how much it speeds up the process of managing projects.

## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

Got put in a team for the PyGame project and started Implementing the basic framework for the game. Even though this week went pretty smoothly, I noticed I waste a lot of my time at home, which could 
be detrimental during the later stages of the project. I also feel that my lack of time management will be a big obstacle once more work starts to creep up on me.


## Week 5

Peer-review finished and first assignment finished! Learned more about academic writing and complexity theory

Worked a lot on the base mechanics of the game. Everything is going really well and I’m satisfied with the progress. I talked with my PASS tutor Louis about time management and he gave me some really useful tips. Decided to slowly start implementing the advice he gave me. I also noticed my broken sleeping pattern is impairing my productivity as sometimes I can’t get up on time to get to uni.

## Week 6

Spent the week with my team working in the studio! Made a lot of progress on the game...

Finished the base mechanics of the game as well as my Tinkering Graphics contracts. All came out really good, but I’m starting to feel all the deadlines creeping up. I focused too much on just this one project and I feel like I’m behind on the other projects. I also feel like I’m still wasting a lot of my time and find it hard to work on more than one project. To counter that I decided to isolate myself from all distractions and focus purely on working and learning.

## Week 7, 8 and 9

and so on...

I have been really struggling these past 3 weeks with both my mental and physical health, hence why I haven’t been updating my journal or doing much uni work. I managed to complete most of the essential tasks that I needed to do, like the agile essay, but not to the standard that I wanted. I haven’t done much work on the comp150 game over the last 2 weeks as well and I feel the deadlines creeping up.  I learned that fully isolating myself from everything was a very bad idea, and it took its toll on my psyche. I still believe I should isolate myself partially, but from things like social media and the like, not from hobbies or other people. Also I learned to manage my money better and not spend too much and I’m planning to learn how to properly budget, as I have been struggling financially lately after spending too much on various unnecessary items, snacks etc. Because of that I didn’t have enough money for food so my health has not been the best due to not eating enough, or eating only very cheap and non-nutritious food. But now that I got some help from my parents with food and money, mostly sorted my mental problems and learned from them, I will try to improve and get back on track with all my university work.

## Week 10

and so on...

Finished the python game project, had the tinkering audio vivas which went really well, met my new team for the second game development project. Did the investment pitch for the python game, which I was pretty happy with, I feel like I improved a bit when it comes to public speaking. I'm getting a bit better at handling my various problems and my health has gotten a bit better, which is good. I will try to keep it up.

## Week 11

and so on...

Had a very interesting weeek, the beginning was really stressful, with the research journal. Pulled an all nighter and did the whole thing almost literally last minute. While doing it I realised that the topic I was researching was actually really interesting, and I felt bad about not working on it earlier and instead procrastinating. So time management and procrastination is still kind of a problem, but I'm sure I'll sort it out eventually. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the first unreal workshop, although I felt it was a bit short. After 4 hours I was just getting started and wanted to finish the whole project we were doing, but It's not good to work for too long I guess, so I'll just wait for the next week's workshop.

## Week 12

and so on...

Last week before christmas, helped my new team come up with a concept for the new game, I think we came up with something pretty entertaining and fun which I'm very happy about. Had the second Unreal workshop which was also pretty fun, even though I kinda screwed it up for myself on the first break, when I got coffee for myself and for the rest my heart was palpitating and my vision was blurry. Need to remember, coffee does not work well with my body.
