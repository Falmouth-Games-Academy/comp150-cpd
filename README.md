# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report
*You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to.*  

*This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.*

# Notes
### Dispositional domain:
Time management, motivation, self-discipline  

### Affective domain:  
Capacity to be aware of, control and express emotions, and how to handle situations in a judicous and empathetic way.  

### Interpersonal domain:
Communication, listening, negotiation, problem-solving, decision-making and assertiveness  
Not everyone has perfect interpersonal skills. The vital skill is managing all people including these kind.  

### Cognitive domain:
Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of your approach to learning.  

As I noticed in the study, one of these things is reflecting on progress. This is mildly ironic. And generally speaking, if there is any case of irony wherein I am the one to call it ironic, it is ironic.  

### Procedural domain:
Identifying the skills you have, and what you need to improve. There is a GDC talk called How to Succeed, Fail and Learn worth watching.

# Arising Problem Areas
## Communication blocks
There are times when I know I need to know something, but don't ask. Things like 'why hasn't x updated the Trello board, and when will they?'.  

The cause is probably that deep childhood etc etc. If I talked too much, people tuned me out. However, I know this stuff is important. Chances are, they do too. So the important thing is to focus on their perspective: expose what they already knew. I could do this by, upon not seeing the Trello boards updated in the first thirty minutes, **asking them what they're currently doing**. When they answer, I'll acknowledge, say my thoughts, and then say **can you add that to the Trello board and stick your name on it?**.  

I probably need to read up on basic psychology to get it just right.  

## Lack of work/underachievement
I need to step back and look at the things that have slowed me down these past few weeks:  

**1. Dialogue system overscoping:** The dialogue system I was making had too many features. We really **need something on the screen**. Now that we're knee-deep into Unreal, I'll make sure I'm making something **presentable to the team** from now on.  
**2. Separate projects:** Oh man. Just **don't do them**. Keep it to one project next time.

# Achievements
## SVN
I've played a role in making sure everyone knows how SVN works. I made a channel in Slack, however I noticed **not many people read it**. There were many who **asked me how SVN works** despite all the information being there. I believe this is fine, perhaps just a lack of self-motivation on their part. Question is, **could I do more to encourage the team to read my tutorial(s)**?

## Hanging out
We really need to hang out more--I notice that we get to know each other best in **scenarios where we're not working**. And I feel it'd be great benefit to know each other, there's more motivation in pleasing people you know well than those you don't--not everyone is as **motivated by work as I am**, and furthermore that motivation very very much excludes Unreal.

# Journal
## Week 1 (29th Jan 2018) (notes)
This week summarised: I tried to finish developing my dialogue system, and had a headache trying to transfer it into Unreal. Learning Unreal is very slow--still don't know how to handle it. Noticing team attendance is wobbly. Trying to learn to become a scrum master and missing many vital elements.

## Week 2 (5th Feb 2018)
This week I continued into the Unreal work. C++ is especially hard to work around, not only because of compile times, but because nobody else uses it. This makes me question my role as a programmer, although the dialogue system is coming together nicely.  

In other news, following Brian's advice in the Week 1 PO meeting, I've been nagging the team more regularly about updating the Trello board. Results are mixed--many say they'll do it, but it just doesn't get done. I figure this boils down to simple forgetfulness, so hope that continued nagging will solve it eventually, but this is a concern for the future. Additionally, I've noted that the scrum master is perhaps meant to take more detailed notes about each member's arrival/departure time, so have updated the timetable accordingly.  

With regards to the former, I'll monitor the success of the 'continued nagging' approach. If the Trello board isn't updated more regularly within the next few weeks, I'll start watching the Trello log each day. If the Trello baord hasn't been updated on that day by any specific person, I'll send a reminder to each person by @'ing them on Slack after the session.  

**(previous notes)**
This week summarised: Managing tasks. Communicating more. Unreal headaches, and perhaps not communicating my own progress enough. Noting a lack of content showing--we need to showcase more.

Later on in this week I realised a scrum master is supposed to, or at least could keep more specific times that people came in. I was always wondering this, but was concerned it was too pedantic--apparently not, this is a working environment after all and stating whether someone was present at no particular time isn't specific enough!  

Started nagging people to update the Trello board a little more. It's still shaky, but I've noticed that a few members are updating me more often about their progress, which is fantastic.  

I'm still bowing under the pressure of Unreal. This week I was trying to merge the projects together into one but couldn't do so without errors from every direction. Even simply renaming a project is enough to make the system cry 'irreparable error'.  

Focus could be the problem, but honestly, maybe I should be seeking more help from the tutors. From a programming perspective, we're not being taught much useful about Unreal. We're not learning Unreal code or Blueprints so far. Even I'm not self-motivated enough to sit through those compile times and hours of headaches over doing simple tasks which I've literally made my own engine to handle in the past. Yet we need self-motivation to learn what we're doing. Props to Tomas for showing the most of it, and to the others for trying--while only some results have cropped up so far, I can see the thousand-yard stare of Unreal terror in their eyes.  

In the meantime, started to work on Arduino project on the weekend. It's fun! And perhaps taking too much of my time. But I love having the freedom to try exactly what I want.  

My personal life is alright. I want to get out more and meet people. On that topic, I note after the lecture today that it'd be a good idea to hang out with the team for more fun stuff as well. We benefit a ton from knowing each other more. I went out with Chris and Dary Saturday--it was great fun--and I think it's good to relax, enjoy ourselves and realise we're not stalking each other's trello activity 24/7.

## Week 3 (12th Feb 2018) (notes)
Another week, another plethora of Unreal errors. On the bright side, I implemented and demonstrated the dialogue system (before it broke again). Meanwhile, I've been working on my Arduino project, building its engine and everything. This is on top of trying to be a better Scrum msater. To my credit, I've been nagging everyone about the Trello boards. However, I have room to improve when it comes to communicating stand-up times, and managing them.  

For the second sprint, I made a new meetings register. I noted a register mentioned on Slack that had a lot more detail, e.g. time in and time out, than the one I was doing previously. I've been largely keeping good track, though there have been occasions where I've forgotten to note down someone's leaving time and do it in retrospect.  

## Week 4 (19th Feb 2018)
This week I implemented shield deflection into Demiurge. By showing this tangible gameplay I definitely **helped inspire** some of the team. While it's a small step, every bit of motivation counts. I hope to continue this trend of showing and inspiring.  

On Friday I made a small pong game. This was an online multiplayer game. While implementing network synchronisation, I decided to create a ControllerMessage type, which specified inputs from players. However, I quickly realised that since the logic was client-side, I was starting to **include state data with input data**. Also, I was **assigning** each element to the objects' variables when they sent and received them. This slowed production significantly.  

Next time in a game jam, I'll create 'state data' for online synchronisation. Each synchronised object will own an instance of this state data, which will inherit from a network message. Thus instead of needing to convert and copy everything when an update is received, a simple memory copy will do the trick. While suboptimal for the final online version, this is appropriate in the LAN-only 'skateboard' version of the product.  

## Week 5 (26th Feb 2018)
**SNOW WEEK!!!**  
Unreal-wise, this week was minimalistic. I made a snowman though, with my Perforce socks on my hands--Michael would be proud! I miss him.  

Anyway, this week I worked a fair bit on **Handzer**, my Arduino game. I've struggled to **prioritise tasks** for this project. My perfectionist brain wants everything to be nice and refined at the beginning, in a total rejection of the iterative approach. Bad perfectionist brain. Bad!!! However, what resulted--my 2.5D level editor--is quite a 'handy' tool to have.  

To counter my non-iterative brain, I've added key commands so that I can control the game with the keyboard as well as the Arduino controller. That might sound small, but **it makes testing much faster** as I can test without the device. It's also giving me new perspectives for my motion detection algorithms by eliminating some of the distracting variables like sensor imprecision.  

To improve, I have set a goal for the game. By next week I'll have a map with bottles or shadow enemies flying towards me, and I can blast them with my laser. This prioritises player experience. I'm already working on the laser blast graphics. It's gonna be great!  

## Week 6 (5th Mar 2018) (220 - TOO MANY WORDS)
This week we crunched for the Demiurge trailer.  

What went well? I completed a ton of small tasks that made the game more player-friendly. This was thanks to having extended time in the studio each day. My personal productivity increased significantly.  

What didn't go well? I realised this week I've been a largely inept scrum master. Depressing. Below are my mistakes, effects and solutions.  
**Polling for meeting times:** Majority opinion was unhelpful, as common motivation was low. Set specific, regular meeting times instead.  
**Communicate meeting times:** Due to the above vagueness, some members were seemingly unsure of when to come in. Take the above action and **keep a Google Calendar meeting timetable.**
**Ignoring the Trello board:** Few volunteered to work on the presentation materials. Add the cards to the sprint if this short-notice happens again.  
**Not suggesting roles:** Mango and I, despite being programmers, did the majority presentation work. This should have been covered by more team members. Tasks should have been **put on the Trello board** and a discussion should have decided who would take which roles.  

Most of this hinges on **being more assertive.** However, I worry how little power I have, and how much I'll lose if the team likes me less. Key question is: **how do you get university students to do unscheduled stuff?**  

## Week 7 (12th Mar 2018) (200 WORDS -- OK)
This was most notably Presentation Week. This was a research presentation followed by the game demos.  

Presenting in front of the entire was an emotionally-challenging task. Presenting a game where the character model was the Unreal dummy was taxing. Speaking with enthusiasm is an absolute necessity, and I haven't yet mastered the task of feigning enthusiasm. However, I felt a sense of pride from actually standing up there. In some ways I knew that the ability to present a game that was flawed beyond my control may well teach me the useful skill of pressing on. I was drained afterward--there were so many skilled and enthusiastic teams presenting their games, and I wished I had been a part of that.  

Behold, the notes written on my phone under my internal tears:
**Challenge**: Microphone is too close. **Solution:** Monitor my position every slide and make sure it's sensible.
**Challenge**: During questions, audience hands are hard to see. **Solution:** Give five full seconds to look for hands.
**Challenge**: Went overtime. **Solution:** Memorise a script. I didn't want to do that, because my improvising skills need honing. But a script is a great backup when things go south.

## Week 8 (19th Mar 2018)
This week was Essay Week, the one week where we had enough time to work on the essay! Woo!

I wrote long peer reviews again. Oops. However, vitally I finished them off within the session this time. We had two minimum to do. I was thorough, and wrote notes of several details that could use improvement, using them to eventually leverage my '3 recommended improvements'. I did more than was needed, but I had time.  

One of the people I reviewed gave me a big thanks the other day and said it helped them a lot. That made me super happy. There may be hope yet! I remain uncertain about the best strategy.  

Something less smooth was the Team Duo's tension this week. I noted something Doug said during the review: If someone isn't doing a task, someone else takes it. It's the Agile way. This introduces two improvements:

- **Only one task per person on Trello**: Makes it easier to notice stalling, and doubles as a clearer task list.  
- **Return noncommunicated tasks to the backlog**: Makes it easier to resolve stalling. Tasks mustn't go over two work days without an update through stand-ups or Trello comment.

## Week 9 (9th Apr 2018) (193 WORDS--OK)
This week I had an epiphany. Our team **doesn't do enough playtesting**. Many of the problems with motivation, knowing what to do, and prioritisation would have been reduced had we organised more times to test the game.  

To help this I started off by prompting a playtest on Monday. Keeping the whole team at attention can be challenging--sometimes it feels like some people don't get involved. I should nag them more we while test it, or maybe structure it so that we each get **2 minutes** to play the game. That's for the future.  

This is so important--we need to see the progress we've made collectively, rather than just our own progress. We should've been playtesting more. I think I had a role in **failing to organise playtests**. From an emotional standpoint I simply didn't like **pressuring them to stay around**: it often feels that **after the PO meeting, everyone wants to go home**. As scrum master I should **organise playtests at regular intervals** and stand unaffected by others' motivation levels. I regret not doing this sooner.  

On the bright side, it got done. We're now working with an appropriate priority list. Deadline-ho!

## Week 10 (18th Apr 2018) (188 WORDS--OK)
Most likely the most stressful week of the year thanks to the two massive deadlines (and an itty bitty 3rd one) in two days.  

**Adding sounds and music to the game was the best thing to happen** in the past couple weeks. Next time it **must be done sooner**--it improved motivation levels significantly, for me at least. Speaking of motivation levels, our writer contributed significantly more work than usual the past two weeks. I noticed that this was partly because she was working on the map despite likely conflicts with our designers.  

That opens an area of improvement: **autonomy**. Being fearful of conflicts with other members' work **reduces productivity**. To reduce this fear we could adopt a 'wilder' method where we **work despite conflicts**, allowing them to happen and resolving them later. This has one key benefit: instead of *discussing* possible differences before work is done, we *see* them side-by-side. It might require more work, but the autonomy of team members will boost their motivation greatly.  

Next time I'll promote this method of working. Two principles: **Continuous integration** and **no fear of conflicts**.

# A retrospect on the game
What a wild ride this was. There are so many takeaway points from this teamworking experience, I couldn't write it down in a way that keeps it brief and concise. Actually, let's do that.  

What did I learn over this, in short?
### Social
* Different people need to be treated in different ways  
* Actions mean more than words--if a team member says they'll do something, get sharp to it fast: are they the kind of person who delivers on their promises?  
* Don't stress myself out. My stress can **affect other people** and it's better that I convey a **positive attitude**.
* **Love the game and the idea**. If people don't love the game and idea, **something's very wrong**!

### Productivity
* Sometimes you gotta ask yourself: **where is the character model?**  
* Give **timeframes** for work. We need to know **when** it'll be done.  
* If work isn't being done by someone else, **do it yourself**.
* Make sure everyone knows how to use the Trello board. Many times, someone grabbed a task, and over weeks, never did it. **One task at a time!**

### Concept
* Large-scale single-player games are too big. If we have a writer, don't try to make a large story game just for them. Scale down the game and the writing will scale down with it.  
* Again, everyone needs to love it.

What could I do to improve some of the above problems?  
* Add **expiry dates** to Trello cards. If they're not done by a certain time and we don't hear from a team member, **they go back**.  
* Find someone to be the **team cheerleader**. Team cheerleaders are funnest personalities on the team and their role is to motivate people and keep track of what everyone's done.  
* **Have regular playtests**. I cannot stress this enough! We **need** regular playtests.  
* Hire a **Producer**. They may or may not be the team cheerleader. They should be **different** from the scrum master because the scrum master coordinates and communicates work, but the producer coordinates and communicates the creative direction of the game.  

## Thoughts
What was my role in this game? It's kind of weird, but there were many times where I felt like the team relied on me. That was nice, but a double-edged sword. For example, when I felt the level design was looking bland, I demonstrated a methodology of designing levels. I took a piece of paper, and converted a dull circle with pits in it into a small branching path with alternating challenges and rewards. On the plus side, I helped inspire the designers to make more complete levels. On the negative side, sometimes my suggestions were taken like commands--for example, one of the designers took the layout I proposed, placing it into the area of the level that I intended to only demonstrate.  

I might have spoken my mind too much in what I now believe was a mostly introverted team. As always, I usually made sure to let others speak and make it clear that my opinion is only mine. But on a psychological level, I might have created a feeling that I was unbeatable--I can make a convincing argument, and can put money where my mouth is, quite fast, through extreme effort. This didn't apply across the board of course, and most of them seemed comfortable saying their views to me. But I don't think that's always a good inspiration. If, conversely, I had an appearance of cluelessness (but reliable so people don't hate me for not delivering on work!), perhaps others would see that as a chance to be the hero of their department, and would produce much better output motivated by the idea that **they're the best one to do the job**.  

But I don't want to change my personality in that way: I have particular opinions about things, and to hide them would not be conducive to good team communication. Everyone should say what they think if they have strong thoughts, so long as the delivery is appropriate. Perhaps I speak too much. But I stop short of anything that I feel is causing undue conflict, and I work reliably according to what we agree on. I'm a little too hardcore either way.  

A more direct solution to that would be to **dedicate clearer roles to everyone**. That could give everyone a sense of identity and purpose, while also giving them more power to disagree with my suggestions.  

## A retrospective on the previous CPD report
This is a chance to critique the action I applied according to my previous CPD report. The fact that I have forgotten the entire thing is bad, but this is a chance to sit down and look at how I was then and now.

### Affective - Social Anxiety and Reaching Out
I **did not achieve this goal**. For a few weeks I was reading the pages as planned, usually at least ten rather than six, but I eventually encountered SilverCloud and opted to move to that instead, as I couldn't actually write anything in the library book and there were no forms online.  

Social anxiety still has a huge impact on my life, but I'm growing increasingly aware of the benefits of getting difficult tasks over with. I still procrastinate when under high pressure, such as deadlines (and by "procrastinate", I mean to work on those instead), but I've consistently found getting things out of the way sooner works best. I haven't had many circumstances where I need to use the phone, so that anxiety still remains somewhat uncontested.  

As for SilverCloud, it hasn't been as effective as I'd hoped. While I use it for retrospectives, the website is so, so sterile, and I'm not a fan of seeing clinicians putting on a smile so that they can convey a particular psychological efefct that they want to have on the user. I'm sharp to that. Just tell me the world sucks sometimes! Be honest or something! I know you're trying to make the user feel comfortable, but psychological tricks don't work as well on me as honesty and strategy.  

### Interpersonal - Being Inspirational
I **achieved the goal** of making at least four tracks of music! According to my diary, some weeks were hollower than others and I produced less than 30 seconds. I felt uninspired at times--that's just how it was. When I pitched the music to the team though, it did inspire some of them. **Yay!** Of course the inspiration was short-lived, though the addition of the music during the final stages of development reignited my own personal motivation to polish and finish the game!  

The music also served as the background track for the trailer, making it an overall successful and very satisfying effort. I loved having my own music on stage. Hope the audience liked it too. (They never knew who made it!)  

It did not bring artistic motivation however, but at this stage I feel this lack of creativity was due to the work ethic and skills of the artists. We didn't have character artists, and there was no 2D concept art; and while I'm unsure of the reasons why, by the 10th week I could assure myself that the ball lay in their court. My music probably wouldn't make a difference.  

### Dispositional - Multi-tasking
I **did not achieve this goal**, or at least not fully. My diary lasted for a while but I soon lost track under the pressure of my assignments. Multi-tasking is still a big weakness for me and I continue to have trouble breaking focus. Focus and comfort are the carrots on my stick.  

I did, however, occasionally employ a **15-minute swap strategy**. This involved giving myself two tasks to do, and for an hour or two, I set a Google Timer when starting the task. Once the timer went off, I reset it and switched to the other task. It was a **fun exercise** and I want to keep doing it. Perhaps I'll set a **specific time and date** per week so that I do it more regularly.

It's possible that this challenge was *too vague**. I had to make additional effort to plan out the tasks in hand, unlike the music task where I had a specific time goals to meet, and a team to present them to as a confidence-building feedback loop. Frankly, I need to be more specific. What creative task shall I do? Should it be art? Video making? Music?  

For my world-building project I think **art** and **music** should be at the forefront. **Music** especially, because that leaves enough abstraction for the artists to fill in the gaps with their own view of the project. Much as mentioned in our lecture earlier this week (10), leaving the specifics blank could make my world much more impactful. The music, however, I can use as a backdrop and demonstration of my skill and style.  

### Cognitive - Class Shenanigans and Instantiation
**Easy-peasy.** I for one thing cannot wait to return to my Genesis project and laugh at all my terrible, m-allocated class code. I used virtual functions for inheritance and tried several new concepts relating to C++ and OOP practices.  

My **fear of inefficiency** is finally dying, supported by the fact that compilers happen to be much smarter than I thought they were. And as is the Agile way, optimisation can and should be done at a later stage than the beginning outside of time-sensitive code. I even ran experiments that showed me the OOP way was in fact faster than some procedural cases, and in other cases there was minimal difference.  

The improvement in programming time is.... questionable. Writing new classes everywhere really is a lot slower than writing sequential function-based code. It's all about the maintainability once it gets too large. I still question the benefits of using OOP in small projects, but that's a topic for another day.  

### Procedural - It's not Broken until It's Made
**Mixed results**... Sometimes I followed this principle, other times I got distracted and didn't. I've improved overall, though. I never made an "Optional" checklist. Not much to say on this one: I need to try it again, and pay attention this time.
