# comp150-cpd

## Week 1 - Beginning 12th September
Having only moved in on Saturday, University life started for me this week with my first two talks on Monday, but these were more overviews in general about what the university and the course expects of me, so no real learning has taken place yet, but I will soon need to attend some events actually relevant to the course. And of course, with a new environment and course comes a brand new set of people, and normally I find that it doesn't take me too long to to mix and intergrate with new people, but regardless, this will be a challenge. I can hopefully overcome this challege by attending the upcoming events and classes such as the Programmer Mixer and the Welcome Meeting and getting to know my coursemates better, and hopefully furthering these interactions by attending the Lego Mindstorms event next week will allow me to further build these foundations, as not knowing my coursemates will defeneitly have an effect on my communicative skills at a later date, which could end up affecting my group project. 
 
## Week 2 - Beginning 19th September
With this being my first "proper" week at University, I am now beginning to become accustomed with the finer details and workings of how my course and the overall establishment operate and what it expects of me, and my first meeting with my personal tutor really helped to cement this. Having completed several group activites with other members of my course, such as the Lego Mindstorms challenge this week, I feel much more comfortable talking and interacting with other members of my group, which was an issue I raised last week. This weeks challenge seemed to lie firmly with time managment, although my team's robot was equipped with all the physical tools to achieve all of the challenges, we simply underestimated the amount of time that it would take to program the robot to complete all of the challenges witht the correct amount of precision, and thus we did not actually complete all of the challenges that we wanted to do, so striving to improve my time management by carefully examining the given tasks will defenietly help me with future projects.  

## Week 3 - Beginning 26th September
This week I actually started to begin using the IDE's and the first programming language that I would have to become familiar with, which is Python, and unluckily for me I have quite limited experience with Python as I used different languages in my BTEC course, but I'm beginning to pick up the fundamentals from the books and papers included in the "Further Learning" sections, and also the books that were suggested to me at the beginning of the course. In one of this weeks sessions we all put ourselves into pairs and were given a task to rectify some issues with a block of code, and although me and my partner succesfully completed the task, we spent a fair amount of time scrathing our heads as were not very familiar with Python's finer details and the way the code had to be formatted, so that was defenietly this weeks challenge, and  to overcome this I will start using the knowledge that I have started gaining from the "Further Learning" materials and put it into practice. 

## Week 4 - Beginning 3rd October
This week we have been delving deeper into Python with introduction of Pygame, and thus began to learn how to create and manipulate objects and texts onscreen, which I managed to get working relatively quickly but quickly became bogged down by reformatting my code and making it look good rather than doing what the other members of the group were experimenting with their code, I think this weeks challenge is my OCD, and as I have now been told by my classmates and lecturers, it's more important to make sure that your code works first and then format it, where as I was just worrying about what it looked like and how it was layed out and thus I was holding myself back by worrying about it, where as others were furthering their understanding of the language and Pygame, so to overcome this problem I will now endervor to make sure that my code works before I begin formatting it as function is much more important than form.

## Week 5 - Beginning 10th October
This week was another full to the brim with learning, this time it as mainly focusing on utilizing version control for use in projects and working in teams, which we will be doing in an upcoming assignment, namely Comp 120, and as always with using new software, I have been struggling with remembering what operations and commands to use when using Git and TortoiseGit, such as Push and Commit, and as having my and my partners code sync up and have no compatibility issues, which could cause issues with time managment and meeting our deadline, so nailing this issue is of the upmost importance, which I will endevour to do by installing both pieces of software at home and practice using them by updating and creating all of the folders nessecery for my upcoming projects.

## Week 6 - Beginning 17th October
This week we started to delve deeper into the theory of Computing in Comp 110, with Computational Complexity, which involved an awful lot of maths, maths that I struggled to remember half of the time, and as a result I'm struggling to understand this week's worksheet, which involves looking at the effiency of algorithms and understanding what they do from just looking at them, and thus I feel that this week's challenge for myself is to better understand this topic as I feel it's very important to lknow about it as otherwise I won't be able to complete the worksheet and maybe other future pieces of work, so I will go over the slides again and try to gain a better understanding so I can complete the work.

## Week 7 - Beginning 24th October
This week's challenge revolved around the comp 120 project with my partner, Nathan was unfortuantely ill for the majority of this week, and thus couldn't contribute to the project and communicate with me in person, and thus I was left to my own devices to advance our project and add algorithms and such, and due to us not setting up a chat channel or VOIP service previously, I had no way of communicating with him about the project, and thus I feel that I have no fallen behind on the project, so to remedy this issue I will now learn to utilise VOIP and text based communication software to communicate with other's in my group who my might not be in lesson so that we can discuss what we are doing.

## Week 8 - Beginning 31st October
This week's challenge was came to me in the form of the presentation that we had to give for the comp150 Agile Development question, as discussed in previous weeks I have trouble with presenting due to my displeasure when talking in front of groups of people, and this week it was worse due to the fact that I had totally forgotten that the presentation was taking place and had not reviewed my notes and thus had to improvise most of what I said on the spot and thus stammered and stumbled over my words a lot, so in future to aid my performance in presentations I will write it down on my calander and review my notes the night before.

## Week 9 - Beginning 7th November
I actually encountered very few challenges this week, but again Nathan was not in during the COMP120 session on a Wednesday, and as the deadline is next Monday I needed to discuss with him the finishing touches we need to do to our code so that it is submission worthy and get the highest mark possible, and thus I had to try and get hold of him on social media 

## Week 10 - Beginning 14th November
This week's challenge was brought about by the introduction of the new COMP120 assignment which was tinkering audio, and due to me forgetting most of GCSE Science, I'm struggling to understand a lot of the theory behind it that is taught in lecture, and such am struggling to start my assignment, which will most likely end up in me struggling for time, so I will need to read further into the theory we are being taught so that I don't fall behind.

## Week 11 - Beginning 21st November 
Struggling with Travis and Branching

## Week 12 - Beginning 28th November
