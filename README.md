# comp150-cpd

## Week 1 - Beginning 12th September
Having only moved in on Saturday, University life started for me this week with my first two talks on Monday, but these were more overviews in general about what the university and the course expects of me, so no real learning has taken place yet, but I will soon need to attend some events actually relevant to the course. And of course, with a new environment and course comes a brand new set of people, and normally I find that it doesn't take me too long to to mix and intergrate with new people, but regardless, this will be a challenge. I can hopefully overcome this challege by attending the upcoming events and classes such as the Programmer Mixer and the Welcome Meeting and getting to know my coursemates better, and hopefully furthering these interactions by attending the Lego Mindstorms event next week will allow me to further build these foundations, as not knowing my coursemates will defeneitly have an effect on my communicative skills at a later date, which could end up affecting my group project. 
 
## Week 2 - Beginning 19th September
With this being my first "proper" week at University, I am now beginning to become accustomed with the finer details and workings of how my course and the overall establishment operate and what it expects of me, and my first meeting with my personal tutor really helped to cement this. Having completed several group activites with other members of my course, such as the Lego Mindstorms challenge this week, I feel much more comfortable talking and interacting with other members of my group, which was an issue I raised last week. This weeks challenge seemed to lie firmly with time managment, although my team's robot was equipped with all the physical tools to achieve all of the challenges, we simply underestimated the amount of time that it would take to program the robot to complete all of the challenges witht the correct amount of precision, and thus we did not actually complete all of the challenges that we wanted to do, so striving to improve my time management by carefully examining the given tasks will defenietly help me with future projects.  

## Week 3 - Beginning 26th September
This week I actually started to begin using the IDE's and the first programming language that I would have to become familiar with, which is Python, and unluckily for me I have quite limited experience with Python as I used different languages in my BTEC course, but I'm beginning to pick up the fundamentals from the books and papers included in the "Further Learning" sections, and also the books that were suggested to me at the beginning of the course. In one of this weeks sessions we all put ourselves into pairs and were given a task to rectify some issues with a block of code, and although me and my partner succesfully completed the task, we spent a fair amount of time scrathing our heads as were not very familiar with Python's finer details and the way the code had to be formatted, so that was defenietly this weeks challenge, and  to overcome this I will start using the knowledge that I have started gaining from the "Further Learning" materials and put it into practice. 

## Week 4 - Beginning 3rd October
This week we have been delving deeper into Python with introduction of Pygame, and thus began to learn how to create and manipulate objects and texts onscreen, which I managed to get working relatively quickly but quickly became bogged down by reformatting my code and making it look good rather than doing what the other members of the group were experimenting with their code, I think this weeks challenge is my OCD, and as I have now been told by my classmates and lecturers, it's more important to make sure that your code works first and then format it, where as I was just worrying about what it looked like and how it was layed out and thus I was holding myself back by worrying about it, where as others were furthering their understanding of the language and Pygame, so to overcome this problem I will now endervor to make sure that my code works before I begin formatting it as function is much more important than form.

## Week 5 - Beginning 10th October
This week was another full to the brim with learning, this time it as mainly focusing on utilizing version control for use in projects and working in teams, which we will be doing in an upcoming assignment, namely Comp 120, and as always with using new software, I have been struggling with remembering what operations and commands to use when using Git and TortoiseGit, such as Push and Commit, and as having my and my partners code sync up and have no compatibility issues, which could cause issues with time managment and meeting our deadline, so nailing this issue is of the upmost importance, which I will endevour to do by installing both pieces of software at home and practice using them by updating and creating all of the folders nessecery for my upcoming projects.

## Week 6 - Beginning 17th October
This week we started to delve deeper into the theory of Computing in Comp 110, with Computational Complexity, which involved an awful lot of maths, maths that I struggled to remember half of the time, and as a result I'm struggling to understand this week's worksheet, which involves looking at the effiency of algorithms and understanding what they do from just looking at them, and thus I feel that this week's challenge for myself is to better understand this topic as I feel it's very important to lknow about it as otherwise I won't be able to complete the worksheet and maybe other future pieces of work, so I will go over the slides again and try to gain a better understanding so I can complete the work.

## Week 7 - Beginning 24th October
This week's challenge revolved around the comp 120 project with my partner, Nathan was unfortuantely ill for the majority of this week, and thus couldn't contribute to the project and communicate with me in person, and thus I was left to my own devices to advance our project and add algorithms and such, and due to us not setting up a chat channel or VOIP service previously, I had no way of communicating with him about the project, and thus I feel that I have no fallen behind on the project, so to remedy this issue I will now learn to utilise VOIP and text based communication software to communicate with other's in my group who my might not be in lesson so that we can discuss what we are doing.

## Week 8 - Beginning 31st October
This week's challenge was came to me in the form of the presentation that we had to give for the comp150 Agile Development question, as discussed in previous weeks I have trouble with presenting due to my displeasure when talking in front of groups of people, and this week it was worse due to the fact that I had totally forgotten that the presentation was taking place and had not reviewed my notes and thus had to improvise most of what I said on the spot and thus stammered and stumbled over my words a lot, so in future to aid my performance in presentations I will write it down on my calander and review my notes the night before.

## Week 9 - Beginning 7th November
I actually encountered very few challenges this week, but again Nathan was not in during the COMP120 session on a Wednesday, and as the deadline is next Monday I needed to discuss with him the finishing touches we need to do to our code so that it is submission worthy and get the highest mark possible, and thus I had to try and get hold of him on social media so that we could discuss the issues and improve the final product.  

## Week 10 - Beginning 14th November
This week's challenge was brought about by the introduction of the new COMP120 assignment which was tinkering audio, and due to me forgetting most of GCSE Science, I'm struggling to understand a lot of the theory behind it that is taught in lecture, and such am struggling to start my assignment, which will most likely end up in me struggling for time, so I will need to read further into the theory we are being taught so that I don't fall behind and ensure that I can create 

## Week 11 - Beginning 21st November 
This week I feel that my progress has come a long way since the start of the semester as I have picked up a lot of new skills that will benefit my future work, such as improved presenting skills and bettered ability to work in a team, however, both the Research Journal and Agile Essay are due next week and I am really struggling with the "Academic" writing style that we are meant to write the reports in as in my previous education, this was not required of me and I am struggling to write anything without worrying that it is not up to scratch, which will affect my ability to actually complete the work on time, I will go back and look at the slides that Michael made and run my work through the tools that were linked at the start of the year.

## Week 12 - Beginning 28th November
This week's challenge comes from something that was introduced a couple weeks back but is still plaguing me this week and that is the use of Travis and Branching within out progamming projects, and although it is quite a minor part of our projects, I just can't seem to get my head around the way in which it works as it requires a quite a lot of code to get the testing scripts to work, but the rest of the team has it sorted so it is important that I understand it, or I might fall behind the rest of them, so to overcome this challenge, I will recap the presentation that Michael gave us, and also complete the tutorials that were gone over in class to better my understanding of the processes. 


# comp160-cpd

## Week 1
This week's challenge comes from our introduction to the new programming language that we are going to be utilising, C++, and although I have some past experience with derivatives of it, I struggled to recollect any details and thus am back at the beginning, and as we are expected to utilise C++ in a worksheet relatively soon, I need to get on top of this problem and bring myself up to speed, so to overcome this I will visit Pluralsight and complete the relevant tutorials that will hopefully get me up to speed with what I need to know, thus allowing me to complete the worksheet with relative ease. 

## Week 2 
This week's challenge comes direct to me thanks to the group our group project, due to the fact that the majority of the team has been taught to use Perforce rather than GitHub, so we now have to utilise that method of version control so that we can keep our project up to date, as if I can't use the software, the developments and implementation of features that I cntribute to the project might clash with others and will delay the creative process and possibly hold the group up, to doctor this issue, I will again look at the tutorials outlined by some of the lecturers so that I can confidently use the software and not have to worry about creating problems for the rest of the team. 

## Week 3
This weeks problem was with Blueprints in UE4 and the way in which they are used, mostly in how they can be implmemented with OOD, as without understanding how they can be implemented, my projects will be very inefficent and won't meet the marking criteria, so I will do some further learning to familiarise myself with them and how they can be used so that I can effectively make use of the blueprints and get my projects completed on time. 

## Week 4
This weeks problem came in the way of the academic essay, the topic that I picked was localisation, and my question compared this process for both games and normal software, as this topic is more heavily discussed with regards to normal software, there is very little material that can be used for the video games side, which means that I will not be able to form a solid argument unless I find some more evidence to support my arguments, so to overcome this problem I will look at more the information sources avalabile to me and find somre more evidence. 

## Week 5
This weeks challenge came from 160 with the introduction of sql databases, as I have not done anything like this before, it's a bit hard to grasp as there is a lot of linux commands to remember to get it to work, and connecting to it seems like a complex process, this problem would cause problems down the road as we have to utilise the server later to work with our game, so to overcome this issue, I will consult the lecture slides that the lecturer has provided and complete the tutorials that are required so that I can use the server for next weeks lesson.

## Week 6
This weeks challenge came in the form of of problems with SVN, my team ran into some issues with conflictions while working on our team project, and although I had learned the basics of the sofware, we had not encountered any confliction yet and so this was a new problem for me. To overcome this issue, I will look into ways of resloving issues, or by enlisting the help of one of the BA's who has more experience with it, as without beign able to commit any of my work done to the project, which will affect my end grade so it is best if I get this sorted quickly.

## Week 7 
This weeks issue stemmed from the Research Journal, with the deadlines fast approaching, I quickly realized that I had not been doing my reading of papers each week as I had planned I would, and so I am quite behind with my work on this, so to rectify this issue, this term I will quickly have to go over my paper to get the assignment, as without reading them I will be unable to do my work. 

## Week 8
This  weeks problem stemmed from my lack of time management with my comp 140, although I have made progress with it and I will meet the deadline, I feel like my project could be better, and this is due to my lack of time management, and as I had vouched to work on this last term but it is still affecting my working practice, this needs to be worked on further to make sure my work can be completed on time and to a good standard in the future. 

## Week 9
This weeks challenge came from the lack of communication within my team project, I found that I would complete work and then be told that it had already been taken on by someone else, which stems from my poor communciation skills and not checking if the SVN has been changed, so to work on this issue before I start work on any task, I will rendezvous with my SCRUM master and ask them, about it as my time will be spared and I will actually be able to produce work that is needed. 

## Week 10
This weeks challenge came in the form of testing our servers that we have been working on, and although it worked in the end, I found it very frustrating trying to get it to work, and this was down to my lack of knowledge of said server, and although Mike had linked us to the documentation on it, I had not read it due to being too busy, but on reflection it was quite important that I got it to work as we are covering something similar to this next year, so knowledge of how it works is key, so to fix this I will go back over the documentation and try to better my undestanding. 
## Week 11
This week's issue was caused by the controller project, as it is due after the Easter break I thought it would be best to get the final touches done to it before the break, but I have come up against some issues with the code which have stopped any progress with the game, so I will have to wait until I come back after to fix it, which in retrospect, i should have asked for help earlier as then I wouldn't be stuck and it would most likely be finished or atleast working by now, to overcome this issue, I will ask for help earlier when I next encounter a roadblock like this as soon as I hit it.
