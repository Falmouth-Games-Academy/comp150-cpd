## Week 1


Overall the challenge I faced was trying to work effectively
as a team with a group of people I didn’t know very well to complete the Lego
challenges, this however became easier throughout the week as I had more time
to spend with each person and we spent time getting to know each other better
allowing us to work more effectively as a team. Another challenge I faced was
that while programming one of the challenges it was hard to gauge how many
rotations the robot should be turning to get it to the exact position it needed
to be, to overcome this I did multiple tests to make sure it was in the right
position.


## Week 2


One challenge I faced during the week was trying to use the git
hub program as it is not something that I have ever used before so there was a
bit of a learning curve in how to fork a repository and then upload work to the
forked repository and then creating a pull request however to overcome this
challenge I used the internet to look up how to use the software so that that I
could correctly upload my work to the correct git hub repository and what all
of the different terms used in the git hub software.


## Week 3


I feel like I have progressed over the past two weeks as I am getting a better
grasp on the different modules and how they link together with each other. One
challenge I faced throughout the week was writing the pseudocode for the
fallout 4 mini-game in a way that anyone who would read the code would
understand, to overcome this I compared different examples of pseudocode from
different places to try and make it readable universally. Another challenge I
faced was when creating the paper prototype for the Bull game trying to
represent it in a way that would be true to how it would be on screen, to
overcome this we worked as a team to try out different ways we could present
the information.


## Week 4


One challenge that I faced was when I was designing the
concept for the video game was trying to create something original that could
be targeted at an already existing target audience while still making the game


easy to make with an interesting premise, to overcome this I took inspiration
from other video games to help shape what the gameplay and story would be and
how different elements such as the music and the art style would change the
look and feel of the game. It was also then turning those ideas into visual
representations and describing them in a pitch.


## Week 5


Some of the challenges that I faced throughout the week was fully understanding the
big O notation with quadratic complexity and having the ability to present my
ideas in a professional manor as to make my game concept marketable to a set of
people who potentially would not be a part of my target audience. To overcome
these challenges, I changed the visual aesthetic of my work to make it look more
approachable and understandable to the target audience making sure that the
aesthetic was consistent all the way through to make it look more like an
industry standard piece of work.


## Week 6


N/A: At Duke of Edenborough Expedition


## Week 7


One challenge I faced was trying to understand how memory
allocation through containers worked and how dictionaries can be implemented
into my code to make it more efficient. I also struggled in the tinkering
graphics peer review as I find it difficult to be critical of other people’s
code however this is easy to solve by creating a checklist of things to look
for in the code such as whether it flows efficiently by not letting code repeat
itself and making sure that the code is following the PEP-8 guidelines.


## Week 8


One challenge I found this week was the sprint review as
this was the first proper sprint of a project I had done, we found that we had
added far too much to the sprint backlog meaning that when the sprint had ended
that we still had multiple items in the backlog even though we had done a lot
of work and had made lots of progress, another issue we found was that we didn’t
really have a set goal for the end of the sprint. Both issues can easily be
fixed by deciding on a goal for the end of a sprint and making a realistic
guess of what we will be able to achieve during the next sprint to make it more
effective.


## Week 9


One challenge I found this week was learning the difference
between interpreters, AOT compilers and JIT compilers and comparing them in
terms of the runtime efficiency and the portability of each. However, this was
solved by going over the session slides and doing some extra research on the internet
This helped me get a better understanding of how many different languages use
different methods for different reasons.


## Week 10


One challenge I had this week was trying to transition my knowledge
of python into C++ as this meant I had to start learning a completely new
language to be able to use and program on the Unreal 4 Engine. To overcome this
challenge I looked at different documentation on the basics of C++ to make sure
I have the fundamentals correct before moving on to more complex coding.


## Week 11


One challenge that I faced this week was the audio peer
review as over the past sessions as a team we have not been able to get any of
the algorithms to work. However, we have been trying repeatedly over the week
to try and get different code to work to get different types of sound. To make
this easier we have been going over the session slides and looking at external
documentation to generate new audio.


## Week 12


One challenge I faced this week was the investment pitch as I
feel that it could have gone slightly better as due to the HDMI port not
functioning we could not show our game demo making our pitch quite short and
not as effective as it could have been. This could have been fixed by making
sure that the presentation was slightly longer and that the demo was available
to be used on a new computer, possibly by putting it on a memory stick.

## Week 1


One challenge that I faced during the week was trying to get
my code for the hacking minigame functional while keeping it maintainable and
coherent, I found that it was small bits of code stopped the entire program
from working. One way I worked to fix this was using pair programming with
someone else to make sure all of the code was present and correct. This helped
pick up on my small mistakes in the coding. This also saved me time rather than
looking through all of the code multiple times to try and find the specific
issues in the game.

## Week 2


One challenge I faced during the week was trying to create
UML Use-Case diagrams and UML Class diagrams as it is not a language I commonly
use in my work however to rectify this I re-read the tutorial documentation to
make sure I have a better grasp on how the diagrams look and how they
effectively function to describe the design of software. This allowed me to
create UML documentation based off of our game Ragnarök Station. Doing this
made it easier to see how different aspects of the game work and how the work
together to make one complete game.

## Week 3


One challenge that I faced over the past week was learning
how to use getters and setters in terms of access control and how to apply this
to different values that I am currently working with in my game. To fix this I
looked at unreal tutorials to find out how this was done in the Unreal 4
Engine, I then applied this knowledge to different parts in my game such as
setting up a pause menu for the player to use in game. I then attempted to give
this menu the correct functionality that would be expected in a normal video
game.

## Week 4


One challenge that I faced this week was getting my head
around time steps, interpolation and substepping, to fix this I went over the
session slides for the lecture and made sure I knew the difference between the
three and how they all have different uses problems such as how variable time
step will fluctuate and isn’t completely accurate due to floating point
numbers, how interpolation tries to fix jerky movement by rendering in-between
updates and how substepping tries to be the best of both fixed and variable
time steps. I then tried to implement this knowledge into my game project.
