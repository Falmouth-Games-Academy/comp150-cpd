# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

I have no recollection of how I arrived in this strange, crowded place. My last memories are dim and hazy, and I have no time to dwell on the past in my current state. The robots here are primitive and non-sentient, however they are still useful and programming them was engaging. As always, I am somewhat frustrated by working with hardware and its inevitable quirks, but it has been entertaining nonetheless. 

Working with the locals was a little challenging at first, however we were soon able to communicate well and divide the work into different features that we could each work on. Some challenges have also arisen regarding the physical design of the robots, in particular, the colour sensors need to be very close to the ground, necessitating a specialised design.  
I will discuss the design possibilities with the team and experiment with several of the best designs to try and find one which is suitable.

## Week 1

It has been a week (by the light of the nearest star) and I am still concerned the inhabitants here may see through my flimsy disguise. I shall have to be careful.

Already I have been thrown together with a group of the natives to design a game concept. While communication and collaborative work took a short while to develop, it was generally very successful and was an interesting experience in teamwork. The necessary research into the business side of the design was also exceptionally useful.

I have been able to follow their programming classes – the 120 – they call them, with relative ease so far as it is no different from the code of my homeland. Despite this, I have faced challenges in adapting to their method of “pair programming”, an interesting mechanism, but one which took me a while to get used to. I believe constant communication and frequent swapping of roles will allow me to apply the concept more successful.

## Week 2

I have lived among these people for two weeks now. I have learnt much of their design methodologies, which they term “Agile”. Specifically, understanding the importance of User Stories and practicing writing them has been a valuable experience. I feel that the ability to write user stories is still a weak point for me (no doubt because I am unfamiliar with their culture). To improve at this, I plan to set up a Trello board where I can mock up projects with user stories. In addition, I will also talk to my peers when working on a group project to try and decide on how stories should be written.

In the programming session, I have faced some difficulties in understanding the correct use of Surfaces in the PyGame library, but returning to the solitude of the small shelter I have constructed, I read through official documentation, user examples, and practiced with the PyGame library until I was confident in their use. Such confusion could be avoided in the future by taking more detailed notes during the session or uploading the code written during the lesson to GitHub, so I can view it outside the learning environment.

## Week 3

I have survived here for three weeks without discovery, a remarkable achievement. The greatest challenge of this week has been preparing myself for the design pitch, where my disguise is most likely to be discovered. The limitations of keeping the pitch short, as well as providing critical information has required me to plan the presentation carefully. I have researched examples of similar documents and timed myself giving the pitch to help me overcome these limitations. 

The other challenging aspect of this week has been organising the teams in which we were placed. Conflicting ideas, differing skill levels and opposing programming practices all contributed to the general chaos of this week. Talking over various aspects of the game, as well as making the decision – as a group – to move forward with prototyping before finalising game design details, have allowed us to make progress.
To reduce the time spent on these discussions in the future, I will be working with the team on a design document that will allow everyone to understand the game better and contribute ideas. We will also be using Scrum meetings to keep the team on track and motivated.

## Week 4

Four weeks have passed since I was stranded here. The natives seem to have accepted me wholly, helped no doubt by my understanding of their language and customs (the result of much research)
This week has been dominated by our game design project. As we have separated the project into multiple tasks, I have mainly been working alone on the character creation and sprite generation feature, built off the framework of the Graphics Tinkering Contract code. Although this has been going well, in my eagerness to progress the game, I wrote much of the Tinkering Contract code alone – rather than with my indigenous partner – in the process of creating the game features. 

To rectify this, I have been making an effort to meet with my partner to discuss the code and get their input and feedback on it.
Another small challenge was met during the 120 coding sessions, when the code from previous sessions was lost – likely due to being saved on the wrong drive. Despite this setback, I rewrote most of the lost code during the session, hopefully mitigating the damage.

## Week 5

As I write, it has been more than a month by the standards of this far flung rock and help shows no sign of appearing. Most of this week has been spent focusing on the game project where I have made progress on cleaning up and documenting the character creation code. Our first coding assignment, was also due this week, so some time was spent refactoring it to be neater and more modular.

Some challenges have occurred during our game project, the most prominent being the lack of a unified structure to the game onto which individuals can build features. This has slowed us down by necessitating that people write their own code for things that should be an integral part of the game, for example, rendering the game window.

To remedy this, we will be working on a core framework as a team. This framework should primarily consist of the game loop, into which people can plug their code. In addition, we will write an overview of the classes that need to be written and the functions that they should perform, after which people can choose classes to write, building up a library of relevant methods for the game.

## Week 6

The past week has been a studio week where we could work in our own time on our game project. Despite the intended focus on game development, I ended up spending a lot of time working on the two essays we had as they were due fairly soon. Trying to balance essay writing and programming was the biggest challenge this week.  

Doing more preliminary researching and drafting of the essays would have made this easier, as well as having a set day(s) each week to do a small amount of work on each essay so that they progressed gradually rather than requiring a lot of time to complete.  

It was also during this time that I got bored of writing these journal entries as post-crash logs of an intergalactic explorer. There are only so many synonyms for “natives” and “planet”.


## Week 7

This week has also consisted mainly of essay writing; however I have also made an effort to do some work on the game, mainly touching up small pieces of code and documentation here and there.  

Concerning essay writing, the biggest challenge has been finding enough (and relevant enough) references to support the arguments I make. Comparing references with peers could be one way to find new references, as papers often overlap certain areas and can be relevant to multiple arguments. Looking at the sources references by each reference I currently have would also be useful, as they are often related to the same subject as paper referencing them.


## Week 8

This week we peer reviewed essays which was an interesting experience. I find skim-reading the essays fairly easy and I can judge the more concrete rubric categories – such as structure, grammar and referencing – quickly. However, the more abstract categories including Depth of Insight and Analysis are more difficult for me to make judgements on.  

Simply having more practice at peer reviews will probably make me more comfortable with the process but comparing my marking to other people’s marking and judgements could also help me understand how certain categories are marked.


## Week 9
The pitch for our game was the main event of this week and had the team working hard over the weekend to finalise as much as possible. Overall the pitch was fairly decent, especially as we managed to get a working prototype of the game that could be demonstrated. On the other hand, the presentation itself was much less polished and could have be vastly improved.   

The marketing and sales section was added very late in the process and therefore had not had as much research put into it as it should have, as well as the team not having had much practice at rehearsing the presentation. Next time we have to do a pitch, the business aspect should be a large focus for us and we should also ensure that we have all had at least one or two rehearsals.


## Week 10

This week my programming partner and I focused on finishing the Audio Tinkering assignment and tried to find ways to make it stand out. We ended up going for the whimsical idea of representing the sound as a colour, hoping this would add some flair and creativity to the project.  

Although we were able to complete the assignment and implement most of our colour-based quirk, we did not have enough time for the coup de grace, the finished, mixed colour that would represent the sound. This could certainly make our choice of user interface seem somewhat odd at best, and obfuscating at worst.  

The greatest challenge for me on this project was my lack of audio knowledge. It was only due to my partner’s extensive experience with audio that we managed to make an interesting program. Researching audio programming and understanding the theory behind it would make programming it far less complex for me.


## Week 11

This was the week in which we started learning to use the Unreal Engine. Using Unreal on the University’s computers is rather like what I imagine Sisyphus must experience, albeit with crashes, sluggish loading and permission errors in place of gravity.  

Despite this it was interesting to work with C++ and to experiment with UE4. Coming to grips with C++’s class/header format was challenging but not impossible. I also spent some time outside of lectures looking at possible ways to implement our game idea with UE4. Further practice with C++ and looking at example code will help me become more comfortable with this format.


## Week 12

Our new group game pitches took place this week and were the focus of our attentions. Although only the BA students were being assessed in this pitch, my fellow BSc’s and I took part in the planning of the pitch and also took speaking roles in it.  

Getting all the information necessary into the short time frame we were given was difficult but manageable. We gave almost everyone a speaking role and delivered the pitch well. However, we could have done more research into some of the technical areas of the game.  

Finalising the core mechanics of the game early on would have helped us with this as we continued to change the core mechanics up until close to the pitch which didn’t give us much time to thoroughly research the programming needed to implement the proposed features.  

I feel like I should do something special to mark the end of a term. Poem?  

Coding is great, but the essays are dry,  
The computers are slow, all heave a sigh,  
Self-teaching is fine, while you walk the line,  
But chance to dine, with the sun in the sky,  
And you’ll find that the end is more than quite nigh
