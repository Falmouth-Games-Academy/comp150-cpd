## Week 1 - Beginning 12th September
Having only moved in on Saturday, University life really started this week with my first two talks on Monday, but these were more overviews in general about what the university and the course expects of me, so no real learning has taken place yet, but I will soon need to attend some events actually relevant to the course. And of course, with a new environment and course comes a brand new set of people, and normally I find that it doesn't take me too long to to mix and intergrate with new people, but regardless, this will be a challenge. I can hopefully overcome this challege by attending the upcoming events and classes such as the Programmer Mixer and the Welcome Meeting and getting to know my coursemates better, and hopefully furthering these interactions by attending the Lego Mindstorms event next week will allow me to further build these foundations. 

## Week 2 - Beginning 19th September
With this being my first "proper" week at University, I am now beginning to become accustomed with the finer details and workings of how my course and the overall establishment operate and what it expects of me, and my first meeting with my personal tutor really helped to cement this. Having completed several group activites with other members of my course, such as the Lego Mindstorms challenge this week, I feel much more comfortable talking and interacting with other members of my group, as I normally find it hard to interface with new people but I really feel these activites helped me feel a lot more comfortable. NEEDS CHALLENGE AND ACTION

## Week 3 - Beginning 26th September
This week I actually started to begin using the IDE's and the first programming language that I would have to become familiar with, which is Python, and unluckily for me I have quite limited experience with Python as I used different languages in my BTEC course, but I'm beginning to pick up the fundamentals from the books and papers included in the "Further Learning" sections, and also the books that were suggested to me at the beginning of the course. In one of this weeks sessions we all put ourselves into pairs and were given a task to rectify some issues with a block of code, and although me and my partner succesdfully completed the task, we spent a fair amount of time scrathing our heads as were not very familiar with Python's finer details and the way the code had to be formatted, so that was defenietly this weeks challenge, and  to overcome this I will start using the knowledge that I have started gaining from the "Further Learning" materials and put it into practice.
