# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

Robot Olympiad was interesting stuff to work with. Although I didn't understand what to do at first, I still got into that and tried to do my best despite not knowing the program that we worked with. Our team wasn't very concerned about this Olympiad and we only got the training points, not going deeper into that. Sadly enough, I wasn't that eager to continue the work as well, which, I think, is my main problem. I need to be more confident in what I'm doing.

## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals

Thinking of a new game's concept is always fun. Making up the game's mechanics, gameplay, etc. was interesting for me. I think we did good work with our team there, although I wasn't a big part of it. Next time I'm definitely going to make big effort for my team. The only thing that confused me there was commercial stuff that we had to do and calculate our budgets. I knew that indie companies are doing everything by themselves, but I didn't expect us to do commercial stuff so soon. That is where I was useless for my team. But at least this was a great opportunity to understand how hard it can be to calculate everything, especially when someone is working in a team of 5 people. Another thing I want to mention is Python. Python is completely new for me. Even though I am total novice at this language, I'm confident that I can master it. It will surely take some time, but eventually I will do that.

## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

This week we were divided into pairs to do our tinkering graphics. At first, I wasn't sure whether I could do my best like that. But soon I understood that this is the only way I can learn Python as fast as possible. As I'm new to Python and PyGame in general, I wasn't sure what I was doing, but with the help of my partner, I could at least understand it. In addition, it was so interesting to see how he did different things, experiments, with our simple code. I definitely should spend more time studying individually.

Agile Philosophy was something incomprehensible to me. I can't tell whether I understood it clearly what Agile Philosophy is. Eventually, I assume, I will get it. The only thing to mention is that I don't have to wait until the very last moment, I should research that by myself. I must grow a habit of that...

## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

First thing first, I was so glad to have a chance of presenting my game that I came up with. It wasn't so easy to make gameplay seem interesting, but that what makes it fun to create your own games. The only thing I struggled with a lot was commercials... I had to research how to calculate everything, which wasn't as exciting as everything else. But I'm glad to briefly understand what it looks like. Unfortunately, I didn't give enough effort in presenting my game. That's why it was denied. But that only means I have much to work with. And next time I will surely make a game that will make everyone tremble with delight.

I thought that our Assignment would take quite some time to make. But luckily, I am in a pair with experienced student, that surely knows what he is doing unlike me. Despite that I was trying to do my best even when not knowing some basics of Python. And with my partner's help I can surely tell, that he helped me a lot.

Version Control wasn't as hard as I expected. No doubt I can clearly understand how it works and why it is useful in every development teams.

## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

Finally, we were divided into teams to make a game, which I was waiting for. Even though it's not as big of a project, but it's always fun to feel like you are a part of a good team. I'm happy to have this team, everyone is so friendly and communicative. Among such people, I also want to become more talkative, which I really lack of. That's a great opportunity to show myself as a good team member as well as learn from others: what they do and how, how they struggle and overcome the problem. This period of time while we are making this game will be a great experience for everyone. Especially for those who are total novices like me. I'm totally looking forward to seeing our final version of the game. Even if this won't be as great as we thought, which I refuse to think about, it will still be a great experience for us!

Programming was fun this week and I assume it will continue that way. Can't say the same for academic writing. This will be tough for me. Nonetheless, managing my time better and spending on writing enough time is eventually what I'm looking for.
