# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

Lego week I felt was really fun, I really enjoyed it as it was challenging and felt like I was accomplishing goals each time we made an improvement. The biggest problem I realised that happened was within a couple days members of the team just stopped showing up or if they did show up they didn’t commit to doing any work. This left me to do the work as I was actually interested in completing the goals(this was true until I realised I could build thor).

## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals

This week I was paired with another programmer and I found this enjoyable as I felt if I was struggling with things I could approach him and ask for help. We added each other on Facebook and discord in order to stay in touch better which I feel is a really good idea. It appears that my pair programmer has a great deal of programming knowledge meaning I was asking for help at places I feel like were silly to be asking. 

## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

Completed the SpaceChem challenge with quite a lot of difficulty  I didn’t manage to complete all set levels and felt quite annoyed at that. I can say I did my best though so that makes me happy  
We also were split into teams and giving a brief for a game we have to do a game design document for which brought many different problems, I.e. people had different points of view and made the progress of the team slow as well as the sharing of work somewhat slack and maybe not everyone taking it seriously with unappreciated jokes made on something we were to show to 'investors'. 
I now have the elevator pitch to make for my own game which I'm really looking forward to.  

## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

After getting feedback from last week about what we did wrong as a team I realised that the problems raised were the problems that I brought up to the team. I know where to improve my own GDD which I really enjoyed making. I am starting to feel more pressure though as I am getting more aware of the amount of work needed to produce I do want to do well but the I seem to be behind and finding it quite stressful. 
We are now split into teams based on what we voted for after we did our elevator pitches and I feel excited again to have a project to get on with although I'm not clear on how we will be attempting to make this game 

## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

Picking my own research question for the essay, was a real challenge as I've never done things like this before. The rate in which I am learning may be increasingly going above my skill set. I was recommended to go to the essay help people but I fear I may be going to bang my head against a wall 
I have also noticed that a few of the challenges set for the python programming stuff I've been struggling with quite a bit and I am starting to feel stupid with not being able to either understand or not being able to do what I feel like I should be able to do  

## Week 5

Peer-review finished and first assignment finished! Learned more about academic writing and complexity theory
