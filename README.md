# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report
*You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to.*  

*This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.*

# Notes
### Dispositional domain:
Time management, motivation, self-discipline  

### Affective domain:  
Capacity to be aware of, control and express emotions, and how to handle situations in a judicous and empathetic way.  

### Interpersonal domain:
Communication, listening, negotiation, problem-solving, decision-making and assertiveness  
Not everyone has perfect interpersonal skills. The vital skill is managing all people including these kind.  

### Cognitive domain:
Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of your approach to learning.  

As I noticed in the study, one of these things is reflecting on progress. This is mildly ironic. And generally speaking, if there is any case of irony wherein I am the one to call it ironic, it is ironic.  

### Procedural domain:
Identifying the skills you have, and what you need to improve. There is a GDC talk called How to Succeed, Fail and Learn worth watching.

# Arising Problem Areas
## Communication blocks
There are times when I know I need to know something, but don't ask. Things like 'why hasn't x updated the Trello board, and when will they?'.  

The cause is probably that deep childhood etc etc. If I talked too much, people tuned me out. However, I know this stuff is important. Chances are, they do too. So the important thing is to focus on their perspective: expose what they already knew. I could do this by, upon not seeing the Trello boards updated in the first thirty minutes, **asking them what they're currently doing**. When they answer, I'll acknowledge, say my thoughts, and then say **can you add that to the Trello board and stick your name on it?**.  

I probably need to read up on basic psychology to get it just right.  

## Lack of work/underachievement
I need to step back and look at the things that have slowed me down these past few weeks:  

**1. Dialogue system overscoping:** The dialogue system I was making had too many features. We really **need something on the screen**. Now that we're knee-deep into Unreal, I'll make sure I'm making something **presentable to the team** from now on.  
**2. Separate projects:** Oh man. Just **don't do them**. Keep it to one project next time.

# Achievements
## SVN
I've played a role in making sure everyone knows how SVN works. I made a channel in Slack, however I noticed **not many people read it**. There were many who **asked me how SVN works** despite all the information being there. I believe this is fine, perhaps just a lack of self-motivation on their part. Question is, **could I do more to encourage the team to read my tutorial(s)**?

## Hanging out
We really need to hang out more--I ntoice that we get to know each other best in **scenarios where we're not working**. And I feel it'd be great benefit to know each other, there's more motivation in pleasing people you know well than those you don't--not everyone is as **motivated by work as I am**, and furthermore that motivation very very much excludes Unreal.

# Journal
## Week 1 (29th Jan 2018) (notes)
This week summarised: I tried to finish developing my dialogue system, and had a headache trying to transfer it into Unreal. Learning Unreal is very slow--still don't know how to handle it. Noticing team attendance is wobbly. Trying to learn to become a scrum master and missing many vital elements.

## Week 2 (5th Feb 2018)
This week I continued into the Unreal work. C++ is especially hard to work around, not only because of compile times, but because nobody else uses it. This makes me question my role as a programmer, although the dialogue system is coming together nicely.  

In other news, following Brian's advice in the Week 1 PO meeting, I've been nagging the team more regularly about updating the Trello board. Results are mixed--many say they'll do it, but it just doesn't get done. I figure this boils down to simple forgetfulness, so hope that continued nagging will solve it eventually, but this is a concern for the future. Additionally, I've noted that the scrum master is perhaps meant to take more detailed notes about each member's arrival/departure time, so have updated the timetable accordingly.  

With regards to the former, I'll monitor the success of the 'continued nagging' approach. If the Trello board isn't updated more regularly within the next few weeks, I'll start watching the Trello log each day. If the Trello baord hasn't been updated on that day by any specific person, I'll send a reminder to each person by @'ing them on Slack after the session.  

**(previous notes)**
This week summarised: Managing tasks. Communicating more. Unreal headaches, and perhaps not communicating my own progress enough. Noting a lack of content showing--we need to showcase more.

Later on in this week I realised a scrum master is supposed to, or at least could keep more specific times that people came in. I was always wondering this, but was concerned it was too pedantic--apparently not, this is a working environment after all and stating whether someone was present at no particular time isn't specific enough!  

Started nagging people to update the Trello board a little more. It's still shaky, but I've noticed that a few members are updating me more often about their progress, which is fantastic.  

I'm still bowing under the pressure of Unreal. This week I was trying to merge the projects together into one but couldn't do so without errors from every direction. Even simply renaming a project is enough to make the system cry 'irreparable error'.  

Focus could be the problem, but honestly, maybe I should be seeking more help from the tutors. From a programming perspective, we're not being taught much useful about Unreal. We're not learning Unreal code or Blueprints so far. Even I'm not self-motivated enough to sit through those compile times and hours of headaches over doing simple tasks which I've literally made my own engine to handle in the past. Yet we need self-motivation to learn what we're doing. Props to Tomas for showing the most of it, and to the others for trying--while only some results have cropped up so far, I can see the thousand-yard stare of Unreal terror in their eyes.  

In the meantime, started to work on Arduino project on the weekend. It's fun! And perhaps taking too much of my time. But I love having the freedom to try exactly what I want.  

My personal life is alright. I want to get out more and meet people. On that topic, I note after the lecture today that it'd be a good idea to hang out with the team for more fun stuff as well. We benefit a ton from knowing each other more. I went out with Chris and Dary Saturday--it was great fun--and I think it's good to relax, enjoy ourselves and realise we're not stalking each other's trello activity 24/7.

## Week 3 (12th Feb 2018) (notes)
Another week, another plethora of Unreal errors. On the bright side, I implemented and demonstrated the dialogue system (before it broke again). Meanwhile, I've been working on my Arduino project, building its engine and everything. This is on top of trying to be a better Scrum msater. To my credit, I've been nagging everyone about the Trello boards. However, I have room to improve when it comes to communicating stand-up times, and managing them.  

For the second sprint, I made a new meetings register. I noted a register mentioned on Slack that had a lot more detail, e.g. time in and time out, than the one I was doing previously. I've been largely keeping good track, though there have been occasions where I've forgotten to note down someone's leaving time and do it in retrospect.  

## Week 4 (19th Feb 2018)
This week I implemented shield deflection into Demiurge. By showing this tangible gameplay I definitely **helped inspire** some of the team. While it's a small step, every bit of motivation counts. I hope to continue this trend of showing and inspiring.  

On Friday I made a small pong game. This was an online multiplayer game. While implementing network synchronisation, I decided to create a ControllerMessage type, which specified inputs from players. However, I quickly realised that since the logic was client-side, I was starting to **include state data with input data**. Also, I was **assigning** each element to the objects' variables when they sent and received them. This slowed production significantly.  

Next time in a game jam, I'll create 'state data' for online synchronisation. Each synchronised object will own an instance of this state data, which will inherit from a network message. Thus instead of needing to convert and copy everything when an update is received, a simple memory copy will do the trick. While suboptimal for the final online version, this is appropriate in the LAN-only 'skateboard' version of the product.  

## Week 5 (26th Feb 2018)
**SNOW WEEK!!!**  
Unreal-wise, this week was minimalistic. I made a snowman though, with my Perforce socks on my hands--Michael would be proud! I miss him.  

Anyway, this week I worked a fair bit on **Handzer**, my Arduino game. I've struggled to **prioritise tasks** for this project. My perfectionist brain wants everything to be nice and refined at the beginning, in a total rejection of the iterative approach. Bad perfectionist brain. Bad!!! However, what resulted--my 2.5D level editor--is quite a 'handy' tool to have.  

To counter my non-iterative brain, I've added key commands so that I can control the game with the keyboard as well as the Arduino controller. That might sound small, but **it makes testing much faster** as I can test without the device. It's also giving me new perspectives for my motion detection algorithms by eliminating some of the distracting variables like sensor imprecision.  

To improve, I have set a goal for the game. By next week I'll have a map with bottles or shadow enemies flying towards me, and I can blast them with my laser. This prioritises player experience. I'm already working on the laser blast graphics. It's gonna be great!  

## Week 6 (5th Mar 2018) (220 - TOO MANY WORDS)
This week we crunched for the Demiurge trailer.  

What went well? I completed a ton of small tasks that made the game more player-friendly. This was thanks to having extended time in the studio each day. My personal productivity increased significantly.  

What didn't go well? I realised this week I've been a largely inept scrum master. Depressing. Below are my mistakes, effects and solutions.  
**Polling for meeting times:** Majority opinion was unhelpful, as common motivation was low. Set specific, regular meeting times instead.  
**Communicate meeting times:** Due to the above vagueness, some members were seemingly unsure of when to come in. Take the above action and **keep a Google Calendar meeting timetable.**
**Ignoring the Trello board:** Few volunteered to work on the presentation materials. Add the cards to the sprint if this short-notice happens again.  
**Not suggesting roles:** Mango and I, despite being programmers, did the majority presentation work. This should have been covered by more team members. Tasks should have been **put on the Trello board** and a discussion should have decided who would take which roles.  

Most of this hinges on **being more assertive.** However, I worry how little power I have, and how much I'll lose if the team likes me less. Key question is: **how do you get university students to do unscheduled stuff?**  

## Week 7 (12th Mar 2018) (200 WORDS -- OK)
This was most notably Presentation Week. This was a research presentation followed by the game demos.  

Presenting in front of the entire was an emotionally-challenging task. Presenting a game where the character model was the Unreal dummy was taxing. Speaking with enthusiasm is an absolute necessity, and I haven't yet mastered the task of feigning enthusiasm. However, I felt a sense of pride from actually standing up there. In some ways I knew that the ability to present a game that was flawed beyond my control may well teach me the useful skill of pressing on. I was drained afterward--there were so many skilled and enthusiastic teams presenting their games, and I wished I had been a part of that.  

Behold, the notes written on my phone under my internal tears:
**Challenge**: Microphone is too close. **Solution:** Monitor my position every slide and make sure it's sensible.
**Challenge**: During questions, audience hands are hard to see. **Solution:** Give five full seconds to look for hands.
**Challenge**: Went overtime. **Solution:** Memorise a script. I didn't want to do that, because my improvising skills need honing. But a script is a great backup when things go south.

## Week 8 (19th Mar 2018)
This week was Essay Week, the one week where we had enough time to work on the essay! Woo!

I wrote long peer reviews again. Oops. However, vitally I finished them off within the session this time. We had two minimum to do. I was thorough, and wrote notes of several details that could use improvement, using them to eventually leverage my '3 recommended improvements'. I did more than was needed, but I had time.  

One of the people I reviewed gave me a big thanks the other day and said it helped them a lot. That made me super happy. There may be hope yet! I remain uncertain about the best strategy.  

Something less smooth was the Team Duo's tension this week. I noted something Doug said during the review: If someone isn't doing a task, someone else takes it. It's the Agile way. This introduces two improvements:

- **Only one task per person on Trello**: Makes it easier to notice stalling, and doubles as a clearer task list.  
- **Return noncommunicated tasks to the backlog**: Makes it easier to resolve stalling. Tasks mustn't go over two work days without an update through stand-ups or Trello comment.

## Week 9 (9th Apr 2018)
Some focus points of this week:
- PASS leader programme and taking up too much time on my weekend. I overestimated the energy I'd have and dealing with the lack of Asda shopping time etc.
- Playtesting! This week I realised the importance of laytesting. 
- Over the holidays: getting people to update the Slack. A lot of the commits over the holidays were by me. I tried to keep everyone up-to-date but it felt largely ineffective. I need to reflect more deeply on this.
