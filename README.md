# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

During this week I initially had trouble interacting with other students. My personality being that of an introvert generally made communication with strangers challenging at first. This is something that I'm sure will becaome easier with time as I get to know people in and outside of class. With little prior experience working in groups, the teamwork involved in building the lego robots was challenging but as the week went on we got better at talking and solving problems we encountered. I definitely found creating programs to pass the challenges easier when I tried it on my own, due to the difficulty in getting my ideas accross to my other two team members. I hope to remedy this as I become more familiar with group work and the abilities of each person. We ended up finishing second which I felt was good considering we had little to no experience working with robots prior to that week.

## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals

On monday we had to come up with our own game concepts, I found this quite challenging as I'm not very creative on-the-fly and dont really like having to improvise. It was good having a couple of other people to discuss possible ideas though. Teamwork really helps with idea generation. The pair programming we were introduced too seems like a really good idea, having someone help point out problems sounds like a great way to learn more quickly although the partner I've been assigned too seems very quiet. Hopefully once we get to know each other it won't be such a big problem.

## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

I had some trouble getting my views across in the teams we were put into for our game. It seemed like everyone having different opinions on what should be done just lead to a lot of mismatched ideas with no consensus on what we should make. Progress seems like its going to be quite slow. I really enjoyed playing SpacChem and completed everything we had to although the levels got a lot harder nearer the end, I spent quite a while doing them. 

## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

I think my game concept pitch went quite well considering how stressed out I was over the weekend trying to come up with a good idea. I just wanted it to be something simple but fun since I'm so new to programming. It was really hard trying to come up with something original. Fortunately I was chosen as a Product Owner so my game is one of the better ones apparently. Version control seems really useful but at the moment looks really complicated to me, I really need to get a handle on GitHub as it seems like it's going to be used heavily. 

## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

I'm in a new team although a couple of the people are from the first team we were put into. I hope we can sort out the communication issues we had from before. I'm finding that we seem to be falling behind on the tinkering graphics exercises, the lesson goes quite quickly and having to look everything up is quite time consuming, especially if you  arent sure you fully understand the previous exercise. Hopefully fiddling with the code in my spare time with my pair programmer will help. It's good to have someone to bounce ideas off and pick up your mistakes. Coming up with a research question was really difficult, it's difficult thinking of one when I'm so unfamiliar with Agile, hopefully more research later will make narrowing it down easier but not having done much academic research before may be a big problem.

## Week 5

Peer-review finished and first assignment finished! Learned more about academic writing and complexity theory

I think our contract works as the brief asks. I don't think its particularly creative or efficient though. I'm pretty sure we could have made it alot better if we knew more about pygame. The time complexity seems interesting, I think I need to do some further learning for the worksheet though, it seems quite complicated and sometimes my mind wanders in Comp110 because the room is so hot and its the end of the day on a Friday. I'll need to look through the slides again. I think the research journal is going to be quite difficult, it's going to take a lot of time just to read the papers, having skimmed a few they all seem pretty foreign to me, I dont really think I know enough about computing to write anything decent. 

## Week 6

Spent the week with my team working in the studio! Made a lot of progress on the game...

Me and Sam got quite alot of work done on our teams game. We went in at 9am every day but one which really helped progress the game. Other members of our team don't seem to be quite as involved unfortunately, including our scrummaster which makes planning and such quite difficult. People do have lives outside of uni and things happen that we cant control so these kind of things happening are inevitable i suppose. At least I got quite a lot done and I'm learning more and more about pygame, some things are still a bit confusing but the code works. I need to keep making to commits to Github to show my individual contributions to the development process. Fortunately me and Sam have been doing that a fair bit so far. 

## Week 7


Got a new Pair Proramming partner, I was quite relieved because me and Sam have been working together quite alot on our game and I know he's a really good programmer which I'm sure will help with our contract and help me to learn more about coding when we work together in class. I was really worried about the group presentation over the weekend. I just feel sick with nerves when standing and speaking in front of people. Hopefully doing it more will help me get over that feeling. Spent basically the entire weekend writing my draft for the agile essay and doing research into the Research Journal. I really need to start doing these things earlier, I tend to leave things that are difficult to the last minute because I worry about them which is a really bad habit. Ironically if I did them earlier I wouldn't worry so much and I definitely feel more motivated to do them when I get into the process. I don't really think My research journal or essay will be very good but who knows.

## Week 8

Relieved that the Essay and Research Journal are done, luckily I found the topic of AI quite interesting so the Journal wasnt as bad as it could have been. I think the other papers would have been too over my head at the moment to interest me. Most of  wednesday and thursday was spent doing the essays so not a lot of work got done on our game or audio assignment outside of lessons. I found the Agile essay difficult to structure well so when it came to my research journal I decided to do research about one topic relating to the paper, write about that topic, then move on to a different topic with a break between each topic, this made things much less stressfull as I only had one thing to focus on at a time rather than the journal as a whole. I had a few issues with my bibliography but managed to get it fixed in the lesson with some help fromm my peers. Need to start committing more to github, we all do in the team I think, we also should start working on our group presentation or I can see it being done the day before which wouldn't be ideal. We should have enough of a prototype to show, whether its impressive enough is another matter. The tinkering audio seems interesting but really confusing at times. Should probably review the slides some more. Thankfully, other students who have more programming experience help out when they can which is really good, its just a shame that im rarely in a position to return the favour, although I suppose when you're pair programming or doing peer reviews we can all spot at least a few things to help each other out.

## Week 9

Got a bit confused by Pass by reference in comp110, should practice it some more at home to make sure I grasp it fully. The lessons in tinkering audio were a bit full on and confusing but we've focused on the parts we need for our contract, I think once all the basics are there it'll be fun to play with. The game prototype is basically ready for the pitch next week, I'm quite nervous about that however. Me and Sam have done the slides for our group with basically no input from the other members and I'm not sure if they're going to even turn up to be honest. It's really difficult to motivate people and keep people included who don't contribute much or even turn up so me and Sam have basically given up at this point and decided to do it all ourselves so that we actually have something to show. Maybe this shows a lack of tolerance on our part as I'm sure there may be genuine reasons for people not being able to contribute as much but it's still a pain. Glad it's nearly finished though.

## Week 10

The pitch went okay, although we werent all there and I had to do more than I was going to but luckily I prepared for that. I really need to work on my nerves, I tend to just say whats on the slides that I prepare beforehand rather than improvise from short bullet point which is not how you should pitch. I guess fully immersing yourself in the slides and practicing pitching a lot beforehand is the way to go and might make me more confident during the pitch and more likely to not falter. At least the game is done and I think it's in a passable state. I definitely dont think it's the worst which is good. The tinkering audio went quite well I think. I felt like I didn't contribute as much as Sam in the beginning but I ended up putting a few nice features in at the end once I really understood how the code worked which I think improved it quite a bit. I'm still pretty useless at peer reviewing code. I think I just need more knowledge and practice at it as it takes me quite a while to think of any useful feedback. I came in on thursday and tried doing the quiz while I waited for the meeting with my new group but I could really concentrate properly in the studio. When I got home I did it pretty quickly, having a pen and paper helped as I'm not particularly great at mental arithmatic as is, let alone with calculus and vector math. I plan tdo the tic tac toe worksheet over the weekend, it looks simple enough but I don't really know how to start. Think I should do a bit more research into data structures.

## Week 11

This week we did more on GitHub, specifically some demos explaining how branching works and we also learnt a bit about how to use TravisCI to test code on GitHub. It's quite complicated so I'll need to revise it more later if I want to really understand it. I also finished workseet D where we had to complete a tic tac toe program in python. It was quite tricky making it from scratch but once I understood the basics of the template it was easier to understand what to do although I couldn't think of a way to make it compatible with varying size grids and players but it works. I think I need to code more, as I don't feel naturally adept enough to instantly see what I should do or how I should do it, I assume that comes with experience. We also learn't about stacks and graphs. As with most of the comp 110 lessons I got the gist while it was being explained to us but I feel if I had to explain it now I wouldn't be sure if I fully understood it or spent enough time using it. In comp120 we started tutorials for Unreal Engine 4 and spent half the lesson trying to get the software to run and waiting for things to compile, luckily my computer at home seems to be a bit faster so it isn't so bad. I need to catch up and complete the first 10 tutorials for next week. It's really nice working with an engine, I think starting with pygame was a good idea because this seems like a step up in complexity but I'm excited to learn C++.

## Week 12

This was a fairly slow week since its the end of the semester, still the maths quiz on rotating vectors was a bit of a chore, I completed it the night before and was able to help out some of my peers with it the next morning which I think actually helped me get a better grasp on the concepts going through it again with other people which was good. I was a bit worried about the pitch (even though I wasn't speaking myself) but the BA students did really well especially compared to some of the pitches we've had to do in the past. The Unreal tutorials were ok, I think it would have been fast at home but it's good to have the lecturers at hand for any problems that arise. Most of the problems seemed to be about the software on the computers not running properly however which is annoying, hopefully most of the computers in the studio wont have the same problems.

# COMP 130 - Semester Two

## Week 1 – 29/01/18

Things have been very slow with the unreal project, I’m currently going through Unreal tutorials just trying to get a basic grasp on how it works, on top of that I’m trying to get to grips with C++ and how it functions with Unreal. Suffice to say I’ve not really made any attempt at anything beyond looking at the twinstick template Unreal has for our group project and trying to understand how that works through tutorials. I did add a basic health variable but that’s all.

## Week 2 – 05/02/18

We got 4 player input with controllers working in the game but think that Beren may have done something that broke the build we had. The build wouldn’t work or even compile on certain computers. We aren’t sure how or why but it’s most likely due to our lack of understanding of SVN. I made it a priority to learn the basics of SVN using a tutorial on pluralsight and managed to put a new working build on our SVN in the meantime just by deleting the broken one and putting together a new one. Luckily we hadn’t made a lot of changes to the template so it wasn’t a big issue but if something like this happens again down the line it could be disastrous. I’ve urged everyone to learn SVN better so hopefully we won’t have these problems again.
We also started learning about the Arduino’s that we will be using for our Alt Controller projects and it seems really interesting and I think I’ll enjoy it (even if I did blow up an LED instantly). 

## Week 3 – 12/02/18

In our group project I think we’re going to go down the route of using blueprints more than C++. We’re having to deal with ridiculous compile times just to see more errors in our code. I think these computers are a big part of the problem so I’ve been trying to use my home PC to do more since it seems to compile twice as fast. This makes communication and teamwork more troublesome however but I’m not sure what to do about that. We should probably work somewhere else in the studio with better computers. I spoke to Brian and he said we can use blueprints to begin with because he understands how much trouble a lot of us are having with learning C++ and Unreal fast enough to keep on schedule with what we want in our games. It’s a shame but blueprints do seem a lot more intuitive to me and I’m making much better progress than I was just trying to use C++. I’ve made a basic player spawn system using blueprints but not much else.
We also looked at creating a Serial Interface for our Arduino’s with Al. It was pretty confusing as Al had to speed through setting it up because he had to do it twice, once for those using C# and again for those of us using C++. Hopefully I’ll figure it out later on when I need to use it because it’s apparently going to be essential to our individual projects.

## Week 4 – 19/02/18

More SVN issues. One of our lectures in the general unreal workshop recommended we ignore the binaries and intermediate folders, which me and Ryan proceeded to do. Unfortunately this has caused some issues where we can’t load the uproject because it says we’re missing files in the intermediate folder. Not sure why this has happened but speaking to some of the programmers on other teams it sounds like this isn’t a problem unique to our project. I decided it would be easier to just re-upload the last working version so that’s what I did and now it seems to work. Luckily we’ve been given a new specialised Unreal workshop and a new lecturer - Jamie - to help with our projects. With his help I think me, Beren and Ryan have a handle on the SVN side of things now and can advise the others if they have any problems. We’ve suggested that only we programmers deal with changing code. Beren has made a function to change the accuracy of the Cow which is great and with some guidance from Jamie I’ve been able to get the Player Spawn System working properly. Hopefully we can keep up this pace now the SVN problems are fixed. 
The C++/C# workshops with Brian are good, even if I don’t understand everything fully. I should go through it more fully in my spare time and make sure I’ve grasped everything. 

## Week 5 – 26/02/18

This week has been really productive for me. I realise that we’ve made so little progress that we’ll never have a working game by the show and tell presentations in a couple of weeks if I don’t start doing more. With that in mind I started the week by implementing a collection sphere for the characters like in the tutorials we did in December. I thought this would be useful for when we design the powerups which will be a big USP in our game. Later on in the week I was effectively snowed in and couldn’t get into uni so decided to do as much work as I could on the player mechanics and getting the abilities working for each of them over the weekend. It was a shame I had to miss one of the Unreal workshops as they have been really useful so far. The mechanics aren’t perfect and I’m hoping some of the other programmers will look at them and make suggestions on how they could be better, particularly the pig’s shotgun, but for now I’m happy that it’s all functioning roughly as it should.

## Week 6 – 05/03/18

Art assets are finally being put into the game! It’s amazing how different the game looks and feels now. It’s still not great but I’m just happy we’ll have something to show in the presentation next week. I’ve continued to work on the different player mechanics and Ryan managed to implement some of the powerups into the game which is great! Beren’s working on the HUD and that seems to be coming along well. I added a night version of the main map and our PO seems to really like it which is good. 

## Week 7 – 12/03/18

Well the Show and Tell was a bit depressing, I don’t think our game was the worst but there were a lot that were better than ours. Sam and Max did a good job presenting it though, I just wish they had more to show off. Communication hasn’t been our teams’ strong point, I was hoping that my contributions would incentivise other members to start working more but with the exception of Ryan, that doesn’t seem to have happened. I’m slightly worried that I’ll end up doing too much because nobody else wants to. On the plus side, Jamie gave me some help with the shotgun ability and gave me a piece of code that works really well for that mechanic. It’s much more efficient than my way of doing it and that’s been really useful for me to help me recognise that using C++ can be much better than relying on blueprints just because they’re easier.

## Week 8- 19/03/18

I spent most of my time over the weekend and the start of this week doing my Software Engineering Essay. I found it particularly difficult researching my topic about test-driven development (TDD) in games. There appears to be very little academic research in the specific subject of games using TDD so I had to use a lot of grey literature to find out more information. This also meant that reaching a definitive conclusion was near impossible considering how opinions on TDD in the games industry vary significantly from person to person.
I’ve noticed a bit of a lag issue with the shotgun ability if you set the spread amount and spread angle really high. It’s not really an issue because the final game won’t have the variables that high but it’s a problem that might have affected things later on if the scope of the game was bigger.  I’ve also started to work on the sheep melee attack again. There were some issues with the first attempt at making it so I’m trying another way. Basically the way it works is by spawning an actor (the weapon) that collides with another character and causes damage. The problem is it doesn’t follow the sheep when the sheep is moving so I’m trying to make the weapon a childactor of the sheep and turn the visibility and collisions of the weapon on/off as an attack. 



## 26/03/18

## 02/04/18

## Week 9 – 09/04/18

So I think me and Maddie (our main artist) are the only ones who did any work over the last 3 weeks. I’m hoping everyone else was just too busy over Easter or have been working on things that just haven’t been put into the SVN yet but I think people just aren’t motivated. On the plus side, working on the game myself has meant that there have been no SVN issues or conflicts. So there’s that. Maddie’s been a machine over Easter though and I’ve managed to implement a load of her new art assets so the game is looking sooooo much better. I used one of her textures, cropped and recoloured it and added them to several of the meshes that don’t have textures because I suspect the artist who made them won’t bother making textures for them. It looks decent though so it’s fine if they don’t, it’s just a bit annoying. I also made a few of the level assets we have into destructible ones so that the players can open up the play space a bit during the round and hopefully alter the tactics of the match. I changed the camera position based on feedback we’ve had and also because a completely top-down view doesn’t do justice to all the effort Maddie’s put into the awesome art assets we now have. I then added a health bar and ability cooldown bar under the players and a particle affect for when the players get hit by an attack. It’s been really fun branching out into learning about these other systems in unreal. 
I’ve also spent a lot of time designing my alt controller for comp140. I started with trying to learn Blender because I heard it was good for making 3D models that could then be 3D printed as I thought I could 3D print most of my controller. After trying to learn Blender I decided to fall back on using SketchUp as I had used it before and I felt like I wouldn’t be able to learn Blender quickly enough. Having modelled the controller, I then sent the main part (the Cannon) to one of the technicians to see how long it would take to print. I’m glad I did this sooner rather than later as I learned it will take significantly longer to print than I imagined (2 days). Hopefully it will get printed over the weekend but I’ve now decided to make the base and support out of wood instead. This will be more physical labour but hopefully it will look better and I’ll have more of a sense of achievement if it goes well.

## Week 10 – 16/04/18

I’ve added a small crosshair to the characters to denote the direction of fire. We really should have been playtesting the game more as these small suggestions really help and should have been thought of sooner. The music added a lot of character to the game and its surprising how much more professional the game feels now. I still think the shooting sounds are a bit loud though. Things were quite stressful during the end of the week. One of the other programmers was supposed to implement the scoring system, a vital part of our game, but didn’t and nobody could contact them so while I was busy at home over the weekend working on my individual Alt-controller project (due in on the same day as the group project) I was asked if I could help with that as well as helping a bit with the menu system and the build getting broken at the last minute. I did what little I could and luckily Brian was able to figure out my mess of a system and help Max implement it without me. I don’t mind the idea of Crunch but when it’s because other people have been lax in their involvement before, it can be a bit frustrating. I think for our next project it would be beneficial to make sure everyone has a basic understanding of the engine, especially the designers. This is probably down to bad communication from me and the other programmers.
Over the week I spent a lot of time physically building my alt controller. I hope I will get marked mainly on the controller rather than the game to go with it as I’ve not really given myself enough time to make a decent game in C++.

## Week 11- 23/04/18

So my alt controller and group project are both handed in. I’ve continued working on my alt controller game after submitting despite knowing it won’t affect the grade I’ll get. I didn’t give myself enough time and wanted to prove to myself that I could have done better if I managed my time better. 
Summary
The fact I was relied on to make large parts of the game myself with little constructive feedback was a big problem.  The nature of our game (multiplayer) doesn’t lend itself to easy playtesting. It’s hard to know what is needed if you’re the only one working on it, especially if you need other people with you in order to playtest basic things about the game.
