# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

The robot Olympiad was very interesting and gave me good insight on what team work will be like working with my colleagues. My team was able agree on a certain type of build and work out the most efficient programming for our robot to complete a task. Whenever our robot couldn't complete a certain task, our team would discuss why and calculate a solution. The only challenging thing about the robot Olympiad was making sure our robot would drive straight

## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals

The introduction to python was very eye opening, I've never used python before so i did struggle to understand what was happening and why. However due to my friendly course mates, i was able to ask for help and explanations regarding my code. I found getting pygame up and running very simple and straight forward. I found spacechem challenging to begin with, but once i started to understand the games mechanics, i started to solve puzzles efficiently. i over came this by asking friends how to use certain symbols and other mechanics i didn't know.

## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

I was very concerned starting my tinkering graphics project due to my lack of experience working with python, however my programming partner was very helpful and together we pulled through and started to slowly understand the language. But i did find the project challenging because not knowing the language means i was just stumped and useless to my partner. i will over come this by watching youtube videos based on the python language learning about the agile philosophy was also very helpful because i was able to discover ways of how our group can function.

## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

I was still anxious working on my tinkering graphics assignment, i felt like i should know what i was doing, but i found it quite challenging. Pitching my game concept was also quite challenging, i was able to come up with a game concept, however, when it came to the business side of things, i struggled because i just didn't really know how the business side works. I also got very confused using version control, however i was eager to learn it knowing how helpful it will be. I will overcome this by trying to spend as much time trying to use version control and watch videos explaining how to use it.
## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

i was very happy when i met my team for the game development project because i know we was going to have good chemistry and be able to discuss and introduce new ideas for our game. Even though i watched some videos based on python, i still felt useless for my partner due to is knowledge on python, however he was still very helpful getting me to understand the language. I will overcome this by spending more of my time researching and trying to use python and understanding its key functions.

## Week 5

Peer-review finished and first assignment finished! Learned more about academic writing and complexity theory
