## Week -

Session 3 - Agile Game Development
In this lecture, we learned about the agile philosophy and how it is applied in SCRUM. In addition, we made a product backlog and a sprint task board using Trello. The major challenge was actually figuring out how each of these worked both alone and together. While they will still take some time to get used to, they have become easier to understand after playing around with them. 

Session 4 - Tinkering Graphics I
During this lecture, we learned how to apply graphics -- such as printing "Hello world!" with different background colours. The challenging part was the actual application of said graphics, as I was quite uncertain on what you really had to type in order to get your wanted results. I overcame this challenge by reading the tutorial guides on pygame's website, and by taking a peek at the code that was submitted on Slack by other students to further understand and analyse what I was actually implementing. 

-- Week 7 --
During our Comp-110 lecture this week, we were introduced to object oriented programming. The live coding example was proven useful, however I still have to learn what's actually going on in the code and why certain pieces of code are doing their specific tasks. Moreover, two more challenges that I encountered this week were trying to understand the 3rd research paper - since it involved quite a bit of math.

-- Week 8 --
This week I was faced with a challenge of deciding a research question for my agile essay and preparing a presentation about it. I had a few vague ideas regarding that, although it was later revealed that I needed to construct a more specific question. Eventually, I decided to present my essay slides privately to my tutor, as I am generally not confident with presenting in front of other people, mostly due to my speaking/oral skills since English isn't exactly my native language. Despite all this, I eventually managed to construct a more specific question with help from my tutor for my agile essay. I will also practice my presentation skills more in order for me to improve both my confidence and oral skills.
