# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

During this week I initially had trouble interacting with other students. My personality being that of an introvert generally made communication with strangers challenging at first. This is something that I'm sure will becaome easier with time as I get to know people in and outside of class. With little prior experience working in groups, the teamwork involved in building the lego robots was challenging but as the week went on we got better at talking and solving problems we encountered. I definitely found creating programs to pass the challenges easier when I tried it on my own, due to the difficulty in getting my ideas accross to my other two team members. I hope to remedy this as I become more familiar with group work and the abilities of each person. We ended up finishing second which I felt was good considering we had little to no experience working with robots prior to that week.

## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals

On monday we had to come up with our own game concepts, I found this quite challenging as I'm not very creative on-the-fly and dont really like having to improvise. It was good having a couple of other people to discuss possible ideas though. Teamwork really helps with idea generation. The pair programming we were introduced too seems like a really good idea, having someone help point out problems sounds like a great way to learn more quickly although the partner I've been assigned too seems very quiet. Hopefully once we get to know each other it won't be such a big problem.

## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

I had some trouble getting my views across in the teams we were put into for our game. It seemed like everyone having different opinions on what should be done just lead to a lot of mismatched ideas with no consensus on what we should make. Progress seems like its going to be quite slow. I really enjoyed playing SpacChem and completed everything we had to although the levels got a lot harder nearer the end, I spent quite a while doing them. 

## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

I think my game concept pitch went quite well considering how stressed out I was over the weekend trying to come up with a good idea. I just wanted it to be something simple but fun since I'm so new to programming. It was really hard trying to come up with something original. Fortunately I was chosen as a Product Owner so my game is one of the better ones apparently. Version control seems really useful but at the moment looks really complicated to me, I really need to get a handle on GitHub as it seems like it's going to be used heavily. 

## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

I'm in a new team although a couple of the people are from the first team we were put into. I hope we can sort out the communication issues we had from before. I'm finding that we seem to be falling behind on the tinkering graphics exercises, the lesson goes quite quickly and having to look everything up is quite time consuming, especially if you  arent sure you fully understand the previous exercise. Hopefully fiddling with the code in my spare time with my pair programmer will help. It's good to have someone to bounce ideas off and pick up your mistakes. Coming up with a research question was really difficult, it's difficult thinking of one when I'm so unfamiliar with Agile, hopefully more research later will make narrowing it down easier but not having done much academic research before may be a big problem.

## Week 5

Peer-review finished and first assignment finished! Learned more about academic writing and complexity theory

I think our contract works as the brief asks. I don't think its particularly creative or efficient though. I'm pretty sure we could have made it alot better if we knew more about pygame. The time complexity seems interesting, I think I need to do some further learning for the worksheet though, it seems quite complicated and sometimes my mind wanders in Comp110 because the room is so hot and its the end of the day on a Friday. I'll need to look through the slides again. I think the research journal is going to be quite difficult, it's going to take a lot of time just to read the papers, having skimmed a few they all seem pretty foreign to me, I dont really think I know enough about computing to write anything decent. 

## Week 6

Spent the week with my team working in the studio! Made a lot of progress on the game...

Me and Sam got quite alot of work done on our teams game. We went in at 9am every day but one which really helped progress the game. Other members of our team don't seem to be quite as involved unfortunately, including our scrummaster which makes planning and such quite difficult. People do have lives outside of uni and things happen that we cant control so these kind of things happening are inevitable i suppose. At least I got quite a lot done and I'm learning more and more about pygame, some things are still a bit confusing but the code works. I need to keep making to commits to Github to show my individual contributions to the development process. Fortunately me and Sam have been doing that a fair bit so far. 

## Week 7


Got a new Pair Proramming partner, I was quite relieved because me and Sam have been working together quite alot on our game and I know he's a really good programmer which I'm sure will help with our contract and help me to learn more about coding when we work together in class. I was really worried about the group presentation over the weekend. I just feel sick with nerves when standing and speaking in front of people. Hopefully doing it more will help me get over that feeling. Spent basically the entire weekend writing my draft for the agile essay and doing research into the Research Journal. I really need to start doing these things earlier, I tend to leave things that are difficult to the last minute because I worry about them which is a really bad habit. Ironically if I did them earlier I wouldn't worry so much and I definitely feel more motivated to do them when I get into the process. I don't really think My research journal or essay will be very good but who knows.

## Week 8

Relieved that the Essay and Research Journal are done, luckily I found the topic of AI quite interesting so the Journal wasnt as bad as it could have been. I think the other papers would have been too over my head at the moment to interest me. Most of  wednesday and thursday was spent doing the essays so not a lot of work got done on our game or audio assignment outside of lessons. I found the Agile essay difficult to structure well so when it came to my research journal I decided to do research about one topic relating to the paper, write about that topic, then move on to a different topic with a break between each topic, this made things much less stressfull as I only had one thing to focus on at a time rather than the journal as a whole. I had a few issues with my bibliography but managed to get it fixed in the lesson with some help fromm my peers. Need to start committing more to github, we all do in the team I think, we also should start working on our group presentation or I can see it being done the day before which wouldn't be ideal. We should have enough of a prototype to show, whether its impressive enough is another matter. The tinkering audio seems interesting but really confusing at times. Should probably review the slides some more. Thankfully, other students who have more programming experience help out when they can which is really good, its just a shame that im rarely in a position to return the favour, although I suppose when you're pair programming or doing peer reviews we can all spot at least a few things to help each other out.
