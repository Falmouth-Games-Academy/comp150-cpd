# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

Started Implementing the basic framework for the game. Even though this week went pretty smoothly, I noticed I waste a lot of my time at home, which could 
be detrimental during the later stages of the project. I also feel that my lack of time management will be a big obstacle once more work starts to creep up on me.
