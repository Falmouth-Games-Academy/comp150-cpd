## Week 1
LEGO robot Olympics, we built and programmed simple tasks with LEGO robots, then programmed them to complete challenges in the second week. My group won because we practised each task repeatedly, the only task we didn’t repeat we failed, this taught me the importance of testing.

## Week 2
Game concepts design, we worked on producing a board game for a certain demographic then pitch our design to the rest of the class, our first attempt was very confusing as everyone’s ideas didn’t match, I also learnt the importance of playing your prototype to find and repair problems before pitching.

## Week 3
Agile game development, I was absent for the morning practical lesson, and learnt about Agile in the afternoon lecture.

## Week 4
Game version control, using TortoiseGit, in groups we had to create the PONG game by transferring Pycharm files between computers, I didn’t transfer any files so therefor didn’t learn how to use TortoiseGit, and barely new any coding to help build PONG. I have slowly learnt how to use TortoiseGit through my 120 tinkering graphics project.

## Week 5
Presenting to game Designers, I spent ages making sprites and nice text boxes to present my game, then on the day I couldn’t show anyone my handout and I forgot all my information, I learnt that I should stay away from presenting and always expect the worse.

##Week 6
Learnt how to use LaTex to write scholarly papers, which I found very difficult to understand but I found if I copied the template from github into overleaf and wrote it in richtext instead of source I could get the hang of it.

##Week 7
Finally chose my Agile question and presented it to an Agile professional, presenting was a tiny bit better than last time, but the agile professional was very pro-agile and my theory was trying to prove agile methodology perticularly scrum is terrible in a classroom situation and she immediatly told me why I was wrong

##Week 8
Was absent for monday and tuesday from flu, wednesday tinkering audio didn't understand any of the lectures and couldn't do the workshop, went over it with Michael understood it a bit better and realised I need to go over my maths again.

##Week 9
Finally made a start on collision for Slime Evo realised I have no idea what a class is and how to make one to track the sprites movement, must talk to one of my tutors about it. Tinkering audio 2 couldn't follow any of the lectures and again couldn't do the workshop. Talked to Ed about starting extra lessons for 1 hour a week just to go over everthing from that week to make sure Ive understood it.
