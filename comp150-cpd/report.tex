\section{Introduction}

With my career goal lying in creating code for the physics engines in games, there are some key skills that I feel are important for me to improve on to make me a better fit a development position, these being: meshing with a new team, the learning of new development tools, presentation skills, time management on coding projects and use of version control. And hopefully by improving on these skills, I can hopefully overcome the obstacles and improve the quality of my future work, both in education and future employment roles.
\section{First Key Skill}

The first skill that came to my attention when looking back at my CPD reports was meshing with a new group of people/team, I have always struggled with this as I don't find it easy to talk to new people, which in the past has lead to myself not speaking my mind about a group decision and getting stuck in a project I didn't have any drive to complete and such feel behind on the work and got a lower grade than I'd hoped. Obviously this skill would be important from a games development perspective as if I was put in a new team, I would not be able to effectively communicate with the other members, which could lead to me being mis-assigned work or my feedback not being implemented into the product, which could degrade from the quality of the final piece as it has in my past projects. I will overcome this obstacle by pushing myself out of my comfort zone when I am put in a new team and lay down my areas of expertise and what I am comfortable undertaking, with progress being marked by myself feeling more confident in my work and the quality of the final product. 


\section{Second Key Skill}

Write about 200 words. As above.

\section{Third Key Skill}

Write about 200 words. As above.

\section{Fourth Key Skill}

Write about 200 words. As above.

\section{Fifth Key Skill}

Write about 200 words. As above.

\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here. Though the conclusion should be brief, no more than 100 words, it should do more than merely summarise the report. Focus on the five SMART actions that you intend to take in order to overcome any challenges and/or obstacles. Contextualise how this will help you towards your intended career goal and how this may improve your project for the next semester.
